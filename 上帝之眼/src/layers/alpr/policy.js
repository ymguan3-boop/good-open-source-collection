/**
 * @file Community-mapped automatic license plate reader (ALPR) camera layer.
 *
 * Data source: OpenStreetMap contributors, including the DeFlock community
 * (`man_made=surveillance` + `surveillance:type=ALPR`) — see
 * https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:surveillance:type=ALPR and
 * https://deflock.org. OSM data remains ODbL 1.0, separate from the MIT code.
 * Fetched viewport-bounded through the existing generic
 * `/api/overpass` proxy (same one `traffic.js` and `militaryInstallations.js`
 * use) — no new server route needed for a single narrow tag pair.
 *
 * This is mapped surveillance infrastructure, not a live camera feed: no
 * plate records, no vendor accounts, nothing beyond what a contributor chose
 * to publish to OSM. Coverage and tag accuracy are not guaranteed.
