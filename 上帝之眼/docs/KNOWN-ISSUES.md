# KNOWN ISSUES

Updated: July 8, 2026

This file tracks active runtime issues only.

For the roadmap and open backlog, see the repository issue tracker.

## Open

### Street traffic can be slow/uneven when panning across dense city blocks
Status: Open (partially mitigated)

Context:
- Current traffic loader fetches one clamped viewport tile at a time (major pass, then full pass).
- In dense cores, some visible roads can appear late after city jumps or fast pans.
- Zooming into adjacent streets does not always immediately trigger higher-detail coverage for all visible roads.

Current mitigation in runtime:
- Fair per-road dot budget allocation (reduces hard starvation under global `MAX_DOTS` cap).
- Center-shift threshold (reduces stale overlap lock while panning).

Next iteration candidates:
- Prioritize currently visible road segments inside the active viewport before off-center segments.
- Add neighbor prefetch ring for nearby tiles after jump-to-city actions.
- Add adaptive dot cap by frame time (coverage first, density second).
- Promote sync chip from loading indicator to true multi-phase progress.

### CCTV panel can appear "missing"
Status: Open (workaround available)

Context:
- The rails lay their panels out themselves. No panel is dragged into place at
  startup and no stored position is read, so a panel that looks missing is
  collapsed or its layer is off rather than parked off-screen. The CCTV panel
  starts collapsed and stays that way until you open it or a camera activates.

Workaround:
- Check that the CCTV layer is enabled in the Layers panel, then open the panel
  from its header control; it also opens on its own when a camera activates.
- To force it open on an ordinary load, store the expanded state and reload. In
  the browser console:
  - `localStorage.setItem('godsEyeView.v6.panelCollapsed.cctv-panel', '0');`
  - `location.reload();`
- Removing that key instead returns the panel to its default, which is collapsed:
  - `localStorage.removeItem('godsEyeView.v6.panelCollapsed.cctv-panel');`
  - `location.reload();`
- Neither console line changes anything when the page was opened from a share
  link: a shared view is laid out from the link, not from what this browser has
  stored, so open the panel from its header control instead.

Related keys (current versions):
- Panel collapsed state: `godsEyeView.v6.panelCollapsed.<panel-id>` — `'0'` open,
  `'1'` closed, absent means the panel's own default. A view opened from a share
  link ignores the stored value entirely.
- Panel positions: `godsEyeView.v8.panelPos.<panel-id>` — the versioned name for a
  stored position. The current layout writes none, so deleting one changes
  nothing.
- CCTV calibration: `godsEyeView.cctv.calibration.v2`

### Height-datum residuals (branch `feat/height-datum`, pending merge)
Status: Open (owner-accepted 2026-07-08, documented)

- **Cold-start floor latency:** at a freshly-visited airport, grounded/low aircraft
  float low for ~1–2 poll cycles (30–60 s) and rise as terrain floors resolve;
  a few stragglers take one more poll.
- **Born-grounded first poll:** a contact first seen on the ground with no altitude
  data renders at the geoid for ≤1 poll until its floor cell warms.
- Full context, improvement ideas, and the verification oracle
  (`scripts/qa-floor-verify.mjs`):
  `docs/superpowers/reports/2026-07-08-height-datum-handover.md`.

## Closed / Intentional (for clarity)

### Proxy SSRF and error-surface hardening gaps
Status: Closed as fixed on `main`

Context:
- Proxy middleware previously allowed broader error/internal surface area and looser upstream handling.
- Current `main` includes hardened proxy behavior in `vite.config.js`:
  - CCTV upstream URL no longer accepted from client query params.
  - Error payloads are sanitized.
  - OpenSky cache stores successful responses only.
  - OpenSky token refresh is coalesced.
  - GBFS/CCTV memory growth is bounded.

Validation target:
- `vite.config.js`

---

### NVG vignette edge color bleed
Status: Closed as fixed in current shader composite

Context:
- Earlier builds leaked original scene colors near the NVG tube edge.
- Current composite now masks NVG output with tube falloff before final blend, removing the color edge bleed.

Validation target:
- `src/styles/surveillance.js`

---

### Wildfires layer unavailable / static bundled snapshot
Status: Closed — live FIRMS integration shipped (2026-07-16)

Context:
- Wildfires (NASA FIRMS) were removed from runtime in v0.5.3, returned June 2026 as a
  bundled-snapshot layer (`local-firms`, 2026-05-25 data, ~58 MB in-repo), and were
  converted to **live NASA FIRMS data** on 2026-07-16: the `/api/firms` proxy merges
  three VIIRS NRT sources (trailing 24 h, 30 min cache, serve-stale-on-failure) and the
  bundled snapshot was deleted. Requires a free server-side `FIRMS_MAP_KEY`; without it
  the layer shows a KEY REQUIRED state.
- Weather radar is still held out of OSS v1 after QA found the previous overlay did not provide reliable visible value.
