# Print the one .AppImage path out of tauri-action's `artifactPaths` output.
#
# Both release.yml and test-build.yml have to hand exactly that path to
# scripts/embed-appimage-update-info.sh. Reading the action's own output beats
# globbing the bundle directory, which also holds the AppImage-packaged build
# tools, and keeping the selection in one place stops the two workflows from
# drifting apart.
#
# Usage:
#   image="$(scripts/select-single-appimage.sh "$ARTIFACT_PATHS")"
#
# The argument is the JSON array tauri-action emits. Exits non-zero unless
# exactly one entry ends in .AppImage, so a bundler change that stops producing
# one (or starts producing several) fails the build rather than silently
# patching the wrong file.

# Read with a loop rather than `mapfile`: that builtin arrived in bash 4, and
# macOS still ships bash 3.2 as /bin/bash, where it is simply missing.
