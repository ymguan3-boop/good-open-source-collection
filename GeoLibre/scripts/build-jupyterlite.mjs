// Build the self-hosted JupyterLite site that the web build embeds in the
// Notebook panel (an <iframe> pointed at apps/geolibre-desktop/public/jupyterlite/).
//
// JupyterLite is a full Jupyter UI running entirely in the browser on a Pyodide
// (WASM) kernel — no server. The desktop (Tauri) build launches a real
// JupyterLab server instead and does not use this output.
//
// This step needs the `jupyter lite` CLI (see
// apps/geolibre-desktop/jupyterlite/requirements.txt:
//   pip install -r apps/geolibre-desktop/jupyterlite/requirements.txt
// ). It is intentionally **best-effort**: if the CLI is not installed, it logs a
// warning and exits 0 so a Node-only `npm run build` still succeeds. When the
// assets are absent the Notebook panel shows a "not built" message on web; run
// this script (or install the deps) to enable it.
//
// Output: apps/geolibre-desktop/public/jupyterlite/  (git-ignored; Vite copies
// public/ into dist/ at build time).
