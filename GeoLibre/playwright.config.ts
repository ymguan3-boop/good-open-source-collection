/**
 * The `core` suite: the app boots and renders a map, and its shared UI surfaces
 * still work. This is the only suite that gates a pull request, so it is kept
 * to the checks that would break *every* user — not per-feature integration.
 *
 * Everything else lands in the `features` project, which runs nightly (see
 * `.github/workflows/e2e-full.yml`). Feature specs are not less valuable — most
 * were written for a specific shipped regression — they are just too slow to
 * charge to every commit: the full suite is ~36 min serial, of which these are
 * ~27 min. Moving a spec between the two lists is the intended way to trade
 * per-commit cost against how fast a regression is caught.
