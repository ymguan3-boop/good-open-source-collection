# GeoLibre AI proxy

Cloudflare Worker that gives GeoLibre an OpenAI-compatible
`/v1/chat/completions` endpoint without shipping an AI provider key in the
application. It routes through Cloudflare AI Gateway's unified API, which
supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and Workers AI with one request
format. It streams responses and requires a server-side GeoLibre instance
token in addition to enforcing a model allowlist, request-size cap,
output-token cap, and per-client rate limit.

## Configure and deploy

1. Review `AI_GATEWAY_ID`, `ALLOWED_MODELS`, and the limits in
   `wrangler.jsonc`.
2. In Cloudflare, enable AI Gateway Unified Billing and create a scoped API
   token with AI Gateway permission. Store it interactively (never put it in
   source or Wrangler variables):

   ```sh
   cd workers/ai-proxy
   npx wrangler secret put CF_AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN
   npx wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID
   npx wrangler secret put GEOLIBRE_AI_PROXY_TOKEN
   ```

   Generate the instance token with `openssl rand -hex 32`. Store the same
   value in the Docker deployment's secret environment; never add it to source
   control or a frontend build.

   The NASA OPERA plugin uses `/search` for GPT-native web search. Configure its
   Anthropic-messages-compatible upstream and store its API key:

   ```sh
   npx wrangler secret put SEARCH_MESSAGES_API_KEY
   ```

   `SEARCH_MESSAGES_URL` (the CLIProxyAPI base URL) and the optional
   `SEARCH_MESSAGES_MODEL` (default `gpt-5.6-luna`) are read off `Env` the same
   way the key is, so set each either as a `vars` entry in your own
   `wrangler.jsonc` or, to keep the URL out of source control, with
   `npx wrangler secret put`. Neither is in the checked-in `wrangler.jsonc`,
   because both are deployment-specific; `/search` answers `503 Search is not
   configured` until `SEARCH_MESSAGES_URL` *and* `SEARCH_MESSAGES_API_KEY` are
   both set.

   To enable the separate `/tavily` route for users who explicitly request
   Tavily, also store:

   ```sh
   npx wrangler secret put TAVILY_API_KEY
   ```

   The Worker can be deployed without either optional search secret. Chat remains
   available, and the corresponding search route returns `503 Search is not
   configured` until its secret is added. All routes share one `AI_RATE_LIMITER`
   budget per client, so the configured limit is what a single user may cost you
   in total rather than a separate allowance each for chat and search.

   ### Serving `/search` from a model's own web search

   `/search` is answered by an endpoint that speaks the Anthropic messages API
   and exposes the server-side `web_search` tool -- a self-hosted
   [cli-proxy-api](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI), for example --
   which removes the Tavily dependency entirely. It returns the same
   Tavily-shaped response as `/tavily`, so a client changes only the path.

   | Setting | Required | Meaning |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `SEARCH_MESSAGES_URL` | for `/search` | Base URL, e.g. `https://cli-proxy.example.org`. `/v1/messages` is appended. |
   | `SEARCH_MESSAGES_API_KEY` | for `/search` | Bearer token for that endpoint. Store with `wrangler secret put`. |
   | `SEARCH_MESSAGES_MODEL` | no | Defaults to `gpt-5.6-luna`. |

   `/search` is always GPT-native web search; `/tavily` is always Tavily. Both
   return `503 Search is not configured` when their settings are missing.

   Upgrading a deployment that set `SEARCH_BACKEND=messages` is a breaking
   change: that variable is gone, so `/tavily` calls Tavily again and answers
   `503 Search is not configured` until `TAVILY_API_KEY` is set. The NASA OPERA
   plugin is loaded from outside this repo and ships on its own schedule, so
   move it to `/search` before rolling this Worker out -- otherwise its disaster
   search 503s for the window between the two deploys. A leftover
   `TAVILY_API_KEY` makes that window quiet rather than loud: `/tavily` answers
   with real Tavily results instead of GPT-native search and nothing errors, so
   delete the secret (`npx wrangler secret delete TAVILY_API_KEY`) unless you
   mean to keep offering that route.

   Two differences from Tavily are worth knowing. Anthropic returns each
   hit's page text as opaque `encrypted_content`, so the model writes the
   per-source snippets that ground quantified figures; they are extracts it
   produces rather than verbatim provider content, and the cited URLs are
   restricted to ones the search actually returned -- *when* the backend reports
   them. A gateway fronting a non-Anthropic model may return the
   `web_search_tool_result` blocks with an empty `content` array: the search ran,
   but its hits never arrive, so there is nothing to check the citations against
   and the model's URLs are passed through on its word alone. Rather than drop
   every source, the route serves them and logs `"grounded": false` on that
   request, so a backend that always strips the hits is visible in the Worker's
   logs. And a search plus a synthesis pass is slower and far more token-hungry
   than a Tavily call -- expect tens of thousands of tokens per search against
   whatever account backs `SEARCH_MESSAGES_URL`.

3. Validate and deploy:

   ```sh
   npm run typecheck
   npm run deploy:dry-run
   npx wrangler deploy
   ```

4. Set the Docker client's URL to the same-origin `/ai` path and let nginx
   inject the server-only instance token:

```sh
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 \
  -e GEOLIBRE_AUTH_USER=admin \
  -e GEOLIBRE_AUTH_PASSWORD='change-me' \
  -e GEOLIBRE_AI_URL=/ai \
  -e GEOLIBRE_AI_MODEL=openai/gpt-5.6-luna \
  -e GEOLIBRE_AI_PROXY_URL=https://ai.geolibre.app \
  -e GEOLIBRE_AI_PROXY_TOKEN="$GEOLIBRE_AI_PROXY_TOKEN" \
  ghcr.io/opengeos/geolibre:latest
```

`GEOLIBRE_AI_PROXY_TOKEN` must match the Worker secret. The browser receives
only `/ai` and the model ID; nginx removes the user's Basic credentials, and
the Worker rejects calls without the instance token. The entrypoint injects the
token on every `/ai` request, so gate the route yourself -- with
`GEOLIBRE_AUTH_USER`/`GEOLIBRE_AUTH_PASSWORD` or your own authentication -- or
anyone who can reach the container spends against your account. Use HTTPS in
front of Docker on untrusted networks, and set `GEOLIBRE_TRUSTED_PROXIES` to
that proxy's IP or CIDR so rate limiting still sees individual clients.

Do not set `GEOLIBRE_AI_URL=https://ai.geolibre.app` in a public browser build:
the Worker deliberately requires a token that must not be shipped to a browser.
Change `GEOLIBRE_AI_MODEL` to another Chat Completions-compatible allowlisted
model, such as `anthropic/claude-opus-5` or `google/gemini-3.6-flash`, to
change provider without changing the client protocol.

## Verify authentication

The health endpoint remains public:

```sh
curl https://ai.geolibre.app/health
```

A direct inference request without the server token must fail:

```sh
curl -i https://ai.geolibre.app/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"model":"openai/gpt-5.6-luna","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

Expected status: `401 Unauthorized`. Test the intended path through the
password-protected Docker host instead:

```sh
curl -u 'admin:change-me' http://localhost:8080/ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"model":"openai/gpt-5.6-luna","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply OK"}],"max_completion_tokens":64}'
```

The client supplies only the Docker username and password. nginx adds the
instance token when it forwards the request.
