// to `tsc` but crashes the app at runtime with "Rendered more hooks than during
// the previous render". `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` catches exactly that class
// of bug statically. We deliberately do not enable the broader recommended
// rulesets here to avoid a large, churny cleanup across the existing codebase;
// that can be layered on later.
