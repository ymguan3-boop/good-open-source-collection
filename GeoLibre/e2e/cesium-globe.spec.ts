/**
 * Smoke test for the CesiumJS 3D globe pane.
 *
 * The globe had no e2e coverage at all: a regression in the camera conversion
 * or the layer/basemap sync only showed up in unit tests driving a *fake*
 * Cesium, which by construction cannot catch anything about the real engine —
 * that the chunk loads, that `CESIUM_BASE_URL` resolves its Workers/Assets in a
 * production build, or that the camera actually moves. Two behavioural changes
 * shipped on the globe (#2205, #2207) verified only by hand in a browser.
 *
 * This runs **keyless on purpose**. `playwright.config.ts` blanks
 * `CESIUM_TOKEN`/`VITE_CESIUM_TOKEN` for the build, which covers a token
 * exported in the shell. Two cases it cannot cover: a token in
 * `apps/geolibre-desktop/.env.local`, which `vite.config.ts` reads straight off
 * disk, and a locally reused server, which Playwright starts without applying
 * that override at all. So rather than assume the build is keyless, the test
 * asserts the tokenless hint and fails with a message explaining both.
 *
 * Until #2205 the pane was hidden without a token and could not mount without a
 * secret; the toggle is now always offered and the globe draws the project
 * basemap. That makes this the guard on that behaviour: if the token gating
 * ever comes back, it fails at `globeToggle` rather than skipping.
 *
 * It deliberately asserts nothing about tiles. Imagery comes from third-party
 * hosts, so a CI runner with no egress must still pass — the globe mounts and
 * its camera works whether or not a single tile arrives.
