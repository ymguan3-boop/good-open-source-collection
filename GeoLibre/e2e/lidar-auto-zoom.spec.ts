/**
 * Loading a point cloud flies the camera to its extent (maplibre-gl-lidar's
 * `autoZoom`, on by default). It stopped doing so on the *first* load of a
 * session: the plugin flips the projection preference to mercator from the
 * `load` event it fires right after starting that fly-to, and
 * `MapController.applyMapPreferences` re-applied the current camera to clamp it
 * to the new constraints — a jump, which cancels an animation in flight and
 * pinned the camera at the world view it started from. Only the first load was
 * affected, because the second one finds the preference already mercator and
 * changes nothing, which is what made it look like a LiDAR bug rather than a
 * camera one.
