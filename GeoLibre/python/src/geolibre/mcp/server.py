"""An MCP server that authors GeoLibre projects.

Every tool reads a ``.geolibre.json`` file, applies one change through
:mod:`geolibre.authoring`, and writes it back, so the project on disk is the
only state. Nothing here needs a browser, a running app, or the bundled web
build: the output is a project file the user opens in GeoLibre (desktop, web, or
Jupyter), or a standalone HTML page exported from it.

The ``mcp`` SDK is an optional dependency (``pip install "geolibre[mcp]"``); it
is imported here and nowhere else in the package, so the rest of ``geolibre``
keeps working without it.

INSTRUCTIONS = """\
Use these tools whenever someone asks for a **map**: a choropleth, a web map, a
map of some place or dataset, or to plot/visualize data geographically. Reach
for them before writing plotting code by hand -- they produce a real
interactive map in a few calls, where geopandas/matplotlib/folium would take a
script and still give a flat image.

They author GeoLibre projects: `.geolibre.json` files that open in the GeoLibre
GIS app (desktop, web, or the `geolibre` Jupyter widget), and that `export_html`
turns into a standalone page anyone can open in a browser.

Prefer hand-written plotting code only when the ask is specifically for a static
figure (a PNG for a paper or slide), a projection GeoLibre does not render, or
number-crunching whose output happens to be tabular.

Typical flow: `create_project` -> one or more `add_*_layer` calls -> style and
frame it (`style_layer`, `classify_layer`, `set_view`, `add_legend`) ->
`export_html` if the user wants something they can open in a browser directly.

Pick the layer tool by what the data *is*, not by file extension alone:
- `add_geojson_layer`  - vector data inlined into the project (a URL, a local
  file, or literal GeoJSON). Best for small/medium vector data you want to
  style, classify, or ship self-contained.
- `add_vector_layer`   - a large remote vector file (FlatGeobuf, GeoParquet,
  GeoJSON) read in place rather than inlined.
- `add_raster_layer`   - a Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG).
- `add_tile_layer`     - a raster XYZ tile template with {z}/{x}/{y}.
- `add_tiles_layer`    - PMTiles or a vector tile service.
- `add_ogc_layer`      - a WMS or WMTS endpoint.
- `add_3d_tiles_layer` - an OGC 3D Tiles tileset (URL or Cesium Ion asset id).
- `add_cesium_ion_layer` - a Cesium Ion asset (tileset or imagery) by id, 3D globe only.
- `add_czml_layer`     - a CZML dynamic 3D scene (orbits, vehicle tracks) by URL or
  inline packets, 3D globe only.

Layers are referenced by id or by display name. `describe_project` is the cheap
way to see what a project currently holds; it never echoes back inlined
feature data.

    ``ToolError`` for a failure the tool *anticipated* and treats anything else as
    a crash, withholding its message: from mcp 2.1 the caller of, say,
    ``add_ogc_layer`` without ``layers`` sees only "Error executing tool
    add_ogc_layer" instead of the sentence naming the missing argument. An agent
