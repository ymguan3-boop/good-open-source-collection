"""Widget-free operations on whole GeoLibre project dicts.

``project.py`` *builds* pieces (a layer, a plugin-state blob). This module
*applies* them to a project: adding and restyling layers, moving the camera,
composing the map controls, and reading a project back as a summary.

Everything here is pure Python on plain dicts, with no widget, no browser, and
no network. :class:`geolibre.Map` delegates to these functions so the Jupyter
widget and the MCP server (:mod:`geolibre.mcp`) share one implementation rather
than growing two copies of the same composition rules.
