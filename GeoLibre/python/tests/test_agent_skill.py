"""Drift checks for the user-facing agent skill in ``skills/geolibre``.

The skill restates things that live in code: the MCP server's tool surface and
the basemap / color-ramp / legend catalogs. Nothing else checks that copy, and a
stale skill fails silently — an agent calls a tool that no longer exists, or
names a basemap the app never had, with no build error anywhere. These tests are
that check.

They skip when the skill directory is absent, so an sdist or wheel install (which
ships only the package) stays green.
