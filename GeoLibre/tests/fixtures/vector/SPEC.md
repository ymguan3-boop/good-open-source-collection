# Shared vector-tool golden fixtures

The GeoLibre vector geometry tools are implemented **twice**, in two languages,
and kept in sync by hand:

- **TypeScript / Turf.js** — `packages/processing/src/vector-tools.ts` (the
  client engine that runs in the browser main thread).
- **Python / GeoPandas + Shapely** —
  `backend/geolibre_server/geolibre_server/vector_ops.py` (the FastAPI sidecar
  engine). `apps/geolibre-desktop/src/lib/pyodide/vector_ops.generated.py` is an
  auto-generated verbatim copy of this file, so it is the *same* engine — there
  are two implementations to keep aligned, not three.

Both expose the same 21 tools and the **same canonical parameter names**, so a
single set of language-neutral fixtures can drive both. (Exception: the two
Data-quality tools, `check-validity` and `fix-geometries`, run on DuckDB-WASM
Spatial client-side rather than Turf, so the TS golden harness cannot execute
them; they are covered by `tests/topology-tools.test.ts` and
`test_vector_ops.py` instead of golden cases.) These fixtures are the
shared contract: each one is an `(input, parameters) → expected` case that both
engines must satisfy. Drift between the two engines is then caught by CI instead
of in the field. This directory is the "shared spec / golden fixtures" called
for by issue #352.

## Files

- `cases/*.json` — one golden case per file (see schema below).
- TS harness: `tests/vector-golden.test.ts` (run via `npm run test:frontend`).
- Python harness: `backend/geolibre_server/tests/test_vector_golden.py`
  (run via `npm run test:backend`).

Add a new shared case by dropping a `.json` file in `cases/`; both harnesses
glob the directory, so no test code changes are needed.

## Case schema

```jsonc
{
  "name": "select-by-value-numeric-gt",   // unique; also the file name
  "tool": "select-by-value",               // a key of the engines' dispatch table
  "description": "…",                       // human note, not asserted
  "input": { "type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [ … ] },   // required
  "overlay": { … } | null,                  // 2nd layer for clip/overlay/union/join
  "parameters": { "field": "pop", "operator": "gt", "value": "100" },
  "expect": {
    // Every field is optional; only the non-null ones are asserted, so a case
    // can assert as much or as little as the two engines genuinely agree on.
    "error": false,                 // when true: both engines must REJECT the
                                    //   input (TS produces no result layer;
                                    //   Python raises ValueError). No other
                                    //   field is checked.
    "featureCount": 2,              // exact output feature count
    "geometryTypes": ["Point"],     // multiset of output geometry types
                                    //   (compared order-insensitively)
    "properties": [ { … }, … ],     // expected per-feature `properties`,
                                    //   compared as an order-insensitive
                                    //   multiset with numeric tolerance
    "geometry": [ { … }, … ],       // expected per-feature geometry, compared
                                    //   in order, coordinates within tolerance
    "bbox": [w, s, e, n],           // expected bbox of the whole output
    "tolerance": 1e-9               // abs tolerance for geometry/bbox/number
                                    //   comparison (default 1e-9)
  }
}
```

## Two tiers of agreement

The two engines do **not** compute identical floating-point geometry for every
tool — Turf buffers in a planar approximation while GeoPandas reprojects to UTM,
Turf and Shapely use different simplification and Voronoi algorithms, etc. So a
fixture asserts at the strongest tier the two engines *actually* share:

- **Exact tier** — tools that are pure attribute/selection logic or carry input
  geometry through untouched (`select-by-value`, `select-by-location`,
  `attribute-join`, `spatial-join`), plus the hand-ported identical Chaikin
  `smooth`. These assert `properties` and/or `geometry` exactly. This is where
  the "kept in sync with the backend" attribute logic lives, so it is asserted
  the hardest.
- **Structural tier** — geometry-approximation tools, which assert
  `featureCount` and `geometryTypes`, plus a `bbox` *only where the two engines
  share the output extent*:
  - **count + type + bbox** — the deterministic set ops and hull whose extent
    matches across engines: `dissolve`, `clip`, `intersection`, `difference`,
    `union`, `convex-hull`, `explode` (carries input geometry through), and the
    deterministic `bounding-box` envelope (its extent is asserted via `bbox`
    rather than `geometry`, because the two engines emit the identical rectangle
    but start the ring at a different corner). `aggregate` also lands here and
    additionally asserts its computed statistic `properties` exactly — the
    pandas numeric semantics are hand-replicated and must match — while its
    dissolved geometry is checked only by `bbox`.
  - **count + type only** — tools whose algorithms differ enough that even the
    extent diverges: `buffer` (Turf is planar, GeoPandas reprojects to UTM),
    `centroids` (vertex-mean vs area centroid), `simplify` (different
    Douglas-Peucker pruning), and `voronoi` (different diagram/clip algorithm).

`reproject`'s client `run` is a deliberate no-op that defers to the Python
engine, so its fixtures are asserted by the Python harness only; the TS harness
skips any tool whose registry entry sets `requiresSidecar`.

## Known behavioral asymmetries

Some differences between the two engines are deliberate rather than drift, and
no fixture asserts them because the engines genuinely do not agree:

- **`buffer` per-feature failure recovery is client-only.** The Turf engine
  buffers feature by feature, so it wraps each one in a `try`/`catch`: a jsts
  throw on a degenerate or self-intersecting geometry is counted and reported as
  `Skipped N feature(s) the buffer could not process`, and the rest of the batch
  still produces a layer. The GeoPandas engine buffers the whole `GeoSeries`
  vectorized, so a GEOS/Shapely throw (uncommon — degenerate input normally
  comes back as an empty geometry, which *is* handled identically as `Dropped`)
  fails the whole request with no partial result and no `Skipped` message.
  Per-feature Python buffering would give up the vectorized path's speed for a
  case Shapely rarely produces, so the messages agree on `Dropped` and diverge
  on `Skipped`.
