 * Client-engine coverage for the Buffer tool's `dissolve` parameter.
 *
 * The Python engine's half of the same contract lives in
 * `backend/geolibre_server/tests/test_vector_ops.py` (see the "buffer dissolve"
 * block): overlapping buffers merge into one attribute-less polygon, disjoint
 * ones into a single multipolygon, and a non-boolean flag is rejected. The two
 * files are kept in step by hand, so a change here needs its counterpart
 * there. What is client-only — the log lines, the single-feature path around
 * turf's two-geometry minimum, and `booleanParam` itself — lives here.
