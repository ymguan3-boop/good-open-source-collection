"""Pure vector geometry operations (GeoPandas/Shapely), framework-free.

This module is the single source of truth for the GeoLibre vector tools. It has
**no FastAPI dependency** so the exact same code runs in two places:

* the FastAPI sidecar (``app/vector.py`` wraps :func:`run_vector_tool` and maps
  the exceptions below to HTTP status codes), and
* the browser, where the source is loaded into Pyodide and ``run_vector_tool``
  is called directly (see ``apps/geolibre-desktop/src/lib/pyodide``).

Keeping one implementation guarantees the "Sidecar (GeoPandas)" and
"Python (Pyodide)" engines produce identical results. Handlers raise
:class:`ValueError` (or :class:`VectorInputTooLarge`) on bad input; the sidecar
translates those to 400/413 responses.
