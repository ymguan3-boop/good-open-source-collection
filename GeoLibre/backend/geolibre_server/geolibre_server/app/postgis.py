"""PostGIS read/write sidecar endpoints (psycopg).

These endpoints back the second phase of database write-back (issue #1070):
loading a PostGIS table as an editable WGS84 GeoJSON layer and committing the
edits back to the source table with per-row parameterized ``INSERT`` /
``UPDATE`` / ``DELETE`` statements keyed on the table's primary key, all inside
a single transaction.

psycopg (v3) is an optional dependency (the ``postgis`` extra): when it is not
installed, ``/postgis/status`` reports ``available: false`` and the desktop app
hides the editable-layer path, leaving the read-only Martin vector-tile flow.

Security posture:

- All identifiers (schema, table, columns) are resolved against the database
  catalogs and quoted with ``psycopg.sql.Identifier``; all values are bound as
  query parameters. Nothing from the request body is interpolated into SQL.
- Connection strings are used only for the duration of one request and are
  never logged or echoed back; error details are scrubbed of anything that
  looks like a password before they leave the sidecar.
- Writes are transactional: any failure rolls the whole commit back.
