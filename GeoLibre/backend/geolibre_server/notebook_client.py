"""``geolibre`` — drive the host GeoLibre map from a notebook cell.

This module is made importable inside GeoLibre's **Notebook panel** (both the
in-browser JupyterLite kernel on web and the JupyterLab server on desktop), and
in any kernel of the desktop app's Jupyter server — including one driven from an
external client such as VS Code's Jupyter extension. It is the kernel side of the
notebook scripting bridge: it forwards commands to the running GeoLibre app.

Scope: this client speaks GeoLibre's **scripting bridge** (the same
``createScriptingHandlers`` surface used by the in-app Python console). That is a
focused map-control API — camera, layers, styling, GeoJSON, processing — and is
intentionally a smaller surface than the full ``geolibre`` PyPI widget (which
mutates a whole project model and renders its own app). Marker/choropleth helpers
here build GeoJSON and add it through the same layer command, so no extra bridge
commands are needed.

Mutation calls are fire-and-forget except ``add_geojson`` on desktop, which uses
the relay's correlated request/reply path to return the new layer id. The same
path powers ``list_layers`` and ``get_layer`` against the live map. JupyterLite
continues to use browser ``postMessage`` without a comm dependency; synchronous
read-back is unavailable there because blocking the Python call would also block
the browser event loop that has to deliver its result.

Two transports carry those commands, picked per call:

1. **The relay** (``geolibre_server/jupyter_relay.py``), when the kernel belongs
   to a GeoLibre desktop Jupyter server. Commands are POSTed to a loopback
   endpoint the app subscribes to, so they arrive no matter which *frontend* is
   driving the kernel — the Notebook panel, or an external client such as VS
   Code's Jupyter extension (issue #1442).
2. **``display(Javascript(...))`` → ``window.parent.postMessage``**, the fallback.
   This only reaches the map when the notebook is rendered inside the app's own
   iframe, which is exactly the case on web (JupyterLite).

When neither can deliver, the call emits a :class:`GeoLibreNotConnectedWarning`
rather than doing nothing at all. Turn it into an error with::

    import warnings, geolibre
    warnings.simplefilter("error", geolibre.GeoLibreNotConnectedWarning)

Usage::

    import geolibre

    m = geolibre.connect()
    m.fly_to(-122.4, 37.8, zoom=11)
    layer_id = m.add_geojson(gdf, name="My layer")  # returns an id on desktop
    m.get_layer(layer_id)
    m.add_markers([(-122.4, 37.8), (-73.9, 40.7)], name="Cities")

Canonical source: ``backend/geolibre_server/notebook_client.py``. The web build
copies it into the JupyterLite contents (see ``scripts/build-jupyterlite.mjs``)
and the desktop launcher copies it onto the kernel's import path
(``src-tauri/src/lib.rs``); keep those copies in sync with this file.
