# GeoLibre Server (Python sidecar)

Optional FastAPI backend for heavy geoprocessing. **Not required** to run GeoLibre Desktop UI.

## Install

```bash
cd backend/geolibre_server
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

## Run

```bash
uvicorn geolibre_server.app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765 --reload
```

Or:

```bash
geolibre-server
```

## Test

```bash
python -m pytest
```

## Whitebox runtime

Whitebox tools use a dedicated GeoLibre-managed Python environment. On first
use, the sidecar looks for `uv`; if it is not available, it downloads the
official uv standalone installer and installs uv into the GeoLibre runtime cache.
It then creates a Whitebox virtual environment and installs
`whitebox-workflows`.

Useful overrides:

```bash
GEOLIBRE_RUNTIME_DIR=/path/to/cache
GEOLIBRE_UV=/path/to/uv
GEOLIBRE_UV_DIR=/path/to/managed-uv
GEOLIBRE_WHITEBOX_ENV=/path/to/whitebox-venv
GEOLIBRE_WHITEBOX_PACKAGE='whitebox-workflows>=2.0.2'
WBW_EXTERNAL_PYTHON=/path/to/python
```

## Conversion runtime

The **Processing → GeoLibre Toolbox → Conversion** menu uses a dedicated managed
runtime (DuckDB + rio-cogeo + freestiler), bootstrapped the same way as Whitebox:
the sidecar finds or installs `uv`, creates a virtual environment, and installs
the conversion packages on first use.

- **Vector → GeoParquet** and **CSV → GeoParquet** also run entirely in the
  browser with DuckDB-WASM, so they work in the web build with **no sidecar**.
- **Vector → FlatGeobuf**, **Vector → PMTiles**, and **Raster → COG** have no
  in-browser writer and require the sidecar.

To enable them, install the optional extras and run the sidecar:

```bash
pip install -e ".[conversion]"
geolibre-server
```

For the **web** build, serve the app from `localhost:5173` — CORS is restricted
to that origin and the Tauri origins, so other ports cannot reach the sidecar.

Useful overrides:

```bash
GEOLIBRE_CONVERSION_PYTHON=/path/to/python   # reuse an existing env (skip bootstrap)
GEOLIBRE_CONVERSION_ENV=/path/to/venv        # managed runtime location
GEOLIBRE_CONVERSION_PACKAGES='duckdb>=1.1.0 rio-cogeo>=5.0.0 freestiler>=0.1.0'  # whitespace-separated
GEOLIBRE_CONVERSION_ROOTS=/data:/srv/geo      # confine inputs/outputs to these roots (os.pathsep-separated; unset = no restriction)
```

When the sidecar is reachable by untrusted same-origin content (e.g. the
bundled Docker image), set `GEOLIBRE_CONVERSION_ROOTS` so conversions cannot
read or overwrite arbitrary filesystem paths. It is unset by default for the
desktop app, where paths are the user's own filesystem.

## Spatial SQL runtime (Apache Sedona)

The **Apache Sedona** engine of the SQL Workspace runs Sedona spatial SQL on
[SedonaDB](https://sedona.apache.org/sedonadb/) (the single-node Rust engine)
through the `/sql` endpoints. It is an optional extra:

```bash
pip install -e ".[sedona]"   # 'apache-sedona[db]' + geopandas + shapely
geolibre-server
```

The sidecar reports availability through `/sql/status`. When the extra is **not**
installed (or the sidecar is not running), the SQL Workspace falls back to the
in-browser [CereusDB](https://github.com/tobilg/cereusdb) engine — a WebAssembly
build of SedonaDB — so the Apache Sedona engine works with **no sidecar** too.
`/sql/run` registers each posted layer as a named view, runs one statement, and
returns rows (geometry as WKT) plus a GeoJSON FeatureCollection when the result
has a geometry column.

## PostGIS connections

The optional PostGIS endpoints are disabled until their database destinations
are explicitly allowed. Set `GEOLIBRE_POSTGIS_HOSTS` to a comma-separated list
of exact hostnames or IP addresses before starting the sidecar:

```bash
GEOLIBRE_POSTGIS_HOSTS='db.internal,db.example.com:5433,[2001:db8::10]:5432'
geolibre-server
```

An entry without a port allows that host on any port; include `:port` to
restrict it. IPv6 entries must be bracketed either way (`[2001:db8::10]`),
since an unbracketed `2001:db8::10:5432` is itself a valid address rather than
an address and a port. Every host in a libpq failover connection string must be allowed.
Implicit local connections, Unix sockets, `service=`, and `hostaddr=`
connection strings are rejected so they cannot bypass the allowlist.

Set it to `*` — on its own, since mixing it with hosts reads as a narrowing but
is not one — to lift the restriction and accept any connection string. The
**desktop app** passes `*` when it spawns its own sidecar — that one is
loopback-bound, token-authenticated, and serves the single user who is also its
operator. Setting the variable before launching the desktop app overrides that
default, so a desktop user can still narrow it. A deployment where the sidecar
is reachable by untrusted same-origin content (the bundled Docker image) leaves
it unset, and PostGIS stays off until an operator lists the databases.

## AI segmentation runtime (SamGeo / SAM 3)

The `/ml` endpoints back GeoLibre's AI segmentation toolbox. They are a thin
reverse-proxy in front of a **separate `samgeo-api` server** (the REST server
shipped with [segment-geospatial](https://github.com/opengeos/segment-geospatial)),
which runs SAM 3 and returns GeoJSON. The heavy model stack (PyTorch + SAM 3) is
**not** imported into this sidecar; install and run it on its own (ideally on a
GPU host):

```bash
# the model server (in an env with a working PyTorch build)
pip install "segment-geospatial[api,samgeo3]"
# the sidecar's ml extra (just an HTTP client)
pip install -e ".[ml]"
```

`samgeo-api` is launched on demand when it is on the `PATH`, otherwise the proxy
returns `available: false` with an actionable message. The desktop app runs the
sidecar in a managed (uv) environment that includes the `ml` extra but not
`segment-geospatial`, so `samgeo-api` is not on its `PATH`; launch the desktop
app with `GEOLIBRE_ML_SAMGEO_URL` set to an external `samgeo-api` (the spawned
sidecar inherits the app's environment). Configuration:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GEOLIBRE_ML_SAMGEO_URL` | Proxy to an already-running `samgeo-api` (no child process is launched). |
| `GEOLIBRE_ML_SAMGEO_CMD` | Command to launch `samgeo-api` on demand (default `samgeo-api`). |
| `GEOLIBRE_ML_DEFAULT_MODEL` | Model the UI defaults to (default `sam3`). |

Each `/ml/segment/*` request takes a multipart `file` plus `model_version`
(default `sam3`) and `output_format` (default `geojson`).

## Future stack

The sidecar will further integrate (see `docs/roadmap.md`):

- **Leafmap** — notebook-style geospatial utilities

GDAL/Rasterio (raster tools), GeoPandas (vector engine), DuckDB Spatial
(conversion), WhiteboxTools, Apache Sedona (spatial SQL), and GeoAI/SamGeo
segmentation now ship as optional extras (`raster`, `vector`, `conversion`,
`whitebox`, `sedona`, `ml`).

Tauri will bundle the sidecar as an `externalBin` in a later release.
