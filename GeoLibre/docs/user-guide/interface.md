# Interface Overview

GeoLibre opens to a single workspace that is the same on desktop and in the browser. This page is a tour of that workspace so the rest of the User Guide can refer to its parts by name.

![GeoLibre interface overview: the Layers panel on the left, the map in the centre, the Style panel on the right, and the status bar along the bottom](https://assets.geolibre.app/images/geolibre-interface-overview.webp)

## The top toolbar

The toolbar across the top of the window groups every action into nine menus:

| Menu | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Project** | Create, open, save, share, import, and print projects. See [Projects](projects.md). |
| **Edit** | Undo and redo, and the feature-selection tools: Select by Expression, Select by Location, zoom to / invert / clear the selection, and Export Selected Features as Layer. |
| **View** | Choose one of the [four rendering engines](rendering-engines.md), zoom in and out, step through viewport history, reset the camera orientation, set an exact view, create a split view, or open the location in Google Maps / Google Earth. |
| **Add Data** | Add layers from files, web services, cloud formats, 3D data, and databases. See [Adding Data](adding-data.md). |
| **Processing** | Run vector, raster, conversion, Whitebox, and SQL tools, plus the [AI Assistant](ai-assistant.md). The menu holds [two separate toolboxes](processing.md#two-toolboxes-in-one-menu), so some category names appear twice. See [Processing Tools](processing.md) and [SQL Workspace](sql-workspace.md). |
| **Controls** | Toggle map controls and component panels (Measure, Bookmark, Minimap, and more). See [Map Controls & Tools](map-controls.md). |
| **Plugins** | Activate built-in plugins and set their on-map position. See [Plugins & Marketplace](plugins.md). |
| **Settings** | Map preferences, layout, environment variables, project settings, and Manage Plugins. See [Settings & Preferences](settings.md). |
| **Help** | The command palette, keyboard shortcuts, diagnostics, feedback, update checks, and the About dialog. |

On the right side of the toolbar are the light/dark theme toggle and the editable project name.

The **Edit** and **View** menus are the two most easily missed, because their contents live nowhere else:

!!! tip "Toolbar labels"
    On narrow windows the toolbar collapses to icon-only buttons. You can also force icon-only buttons from **Settings → Layout**, or with the `toolbar=icons` URL parameter. See [Embedding & Sharing](embedding.md).

## Command palette and keyboard shortcuts

Every menu and toolbar action is also reachable from the keyboard, so you don't have to hunt through nested menus.

- **Command palette** — press `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `K` (or **Help → Command Palette**) to open a searchable list of actions: Add Data sources, Processing tools, Controls, Plugins, and more. Type to filter, move the highlight with the arrow keys, and press `Enter` to run the highlighted command.
- **Keyboard shortcuts cheat sheet** — press `?` (or **Help → Keyboard Shortcuts**) to see the full list of global shortcuts.

![The command palette, listing every Add Data source, Processing tool, control, and plugin in one searchable list](https://assets.geolibre.app/images/geolibre-command-palette.webp)

The built-in global shortcuts are:

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `K` | Open the command palette |
| `?` | Show the keyboard shortcuts |
| `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `N` | New project |
| `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `O` | Open project from file |
| `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `S` | Save project |
| `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `Shift` + `S` | Save project as… |
| `C` | Toggle the [review comment](map-controls.md#review-comments) tool, then click the map to place the pin |
| `N` | Reset bearing (north up) |
| `U` | Reset pitch (top-down view) |
| `R` | Reset pitch and bearing |
| `[` | Previous view |
| `]` | Next view |

The single-key view shortcuts mirror Google Earth Pro (`N` for north up, `U` for top-down, `R` to reset the view) and work anywhere in the app.

![The keyboard shortcuts cheat sheet, grouped by General, Project, Add Data, View, and Map navigation](https://assets.geolibre.app/images/geolibre-keyboard-shortcuts.webp)

While the map has keyboard focus, MapLibre's own navigation keys are also available:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `+` / `-` | Zoom in / out |
| Arrow keys | Pan |
| `Shift` + `←` / `→` | Rotate |
| `Shift` + `↑` / `↓` | Tilt |

Shortcuts are ignored while you are typing in a text field, so they never interfere with search boxes or attribute editing. On macOS the `Cmd` key is used; on Windows and Linux the `Ctrl` key is used.

## The side panels

Four dockable panels surround the map, plus the attribute table along the bottom. The left and right edges carry a vertical rail of tabs — **Browser** and **Layers** on the left, **Comments** and **Style** on the right — and clicking a tab expands that panel.

| Panel | Where | What it holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Layers** | Left | The layer stack, including the basemap. Toggle visibility, change opacity, reorder layers, zoom to a layer, identify features, and open per-layer actions. See [Managing Layers](layers.md). |
| **Browser** | Left | A QGIS-style Data Source Manager: saved map services, database connections, recent items, and your personal **My Data** layer library, all addable without going through a menu. See [Adding Data](adding-data.md#the-browser-panel). |
| **Style** | Right | The styling controls for the selected layer, including data-driven styling for vector layers and image adjustments for rasters. See [Styling Layers](styling.md). |
| **Comments** | Right | Anchored review notes and their threads. See [Review comments](map-controls.md#review-comments). |
| **Attribute table** | Bottom | The attributes of the selected vector or DuckDB layer, with its own explorer, statistics, chart, and export tools. Expand it from the status bar. See [Attribute Table](attribute-table.md). |

The Layers, Style, and Attribute panels can each be shown or hidden from **Settings → Layout**, and panels auto-hide on small screens. Resize the Layers and Style panels by dragging their inner edge, and the attribute table by dragging its top edge.

## The map

The map fills the center of the workspace. It uses MapLibre GL JS for vector and raster rendering, with deck.gl for point clouds, 3D tiles, and other advanced overlays. Pan by dragging, zoom with the scroll wheel or the on-map zoom buttons, **rotate** by holding the right mouse button and dragging, **tilt** by holding `Ctrl`/`Cmd` and dragging, and reset north with the compass button.

On-map controls such as zoom, globe, fullscreen, and the Layer Control appear in the corners. Which controls are shown is set from the [Controls menu](map-controls.md).

## The status bar

The status bar along the bottom reports the live state of the map, from left to right:

| Readout | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Coords** | The coordinate under the pointer. Click it to switch notation — see below. |
| **Elev** | The ground elevation under the pointer. Off by default; see [Elevation readout](#elevation-readout). |
| **GPS** | The current fix, while [GPS tracking](map-controls.md#gps-tracking) is running. |
| **Zoom** | The map zoom level, to two decimals. |
| **Eye alt** | The camera's altitude above sea level — the same quantity Google Earth Pro calls *Eye alt*. |
| **Bearing** / **Pitch** | The camera rotation and tilt, in degrees. |
| **BBox** | The bounding box of the current view (hidden on narrow windows). |

It also holds a button to expand the [Attribute Table](attribute-table.md) and a **Diagnostics** button (also under **Help**) that surfaces any runtime errors.

**Eye alt** is scaled to the active celestial body, so it stays correct on a Mars or Moon basemap rather than reporting an Earth-derived height, and it follows the **Scale bar units** preference (metres/kilometres, feet/miles, or nautical miles). See [Settings → Map Preferences](settings.md#map-preferences).

### Coordinate format

GeoLibre can report the pointer coordinate in four notations:

| Format | Example |
| --- | --- |
| **Decimal degrees** (default) | `-83.92074, 35.96064` |
| **Degrees, minutes, seconds** | `35°57'38.3"N 83°55'14.66"W` |
| **Degrees, decimal minutes** | `35°57.6384'N 83°55.2444'W` |
| **UTM (zone, easting/northing)** | `17S 236594mE 3983527mN` |

Decimal degrees are written longitude-first, matching GeoJSON and the rest of the app; DMS and DDM lead with latitude, the way those notations are conventionally written.

Click the coordinates in the status bar to cycle through them, or set the notation in **Settings → Map Preferences → Coordinate format**. The choice is saved with the project.

The UTM readout uses the same projection that draws the [Gridlines](map-controls.md#camera-overlay-and-recording-tools) UTM grid, so the numbers in the status bar always agree with the grid on screen. Outside the UTM latitude band (below 80°S or above 84°N) there is no valid UTM coordinate, and the readout falls back to decimal degrees.

### Elevation readout

**Controls → Elevation** turns on the **Elev** readout. It is **off by default**, and it resolves the height under the pointer from one of two sources:

- **From the map's own 3D terrain**, whenever a usable sample is available there. This is instant, tracks the cursor live, and sends nothing off your device.
- **From the public [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) elevation API** when terrain returns no value for that point — because 3D terrain is off, but also when it is on and the terrain has no sample to give. The lookup waits until the pointer has been still for half a second, caches results per roughly 11 m cell, and runs only on Earth, never on a planetary basemap.

Because that fallback sends the coordinates under your pointer to a third-party service, GeoLibre asks for consent the first time you enable the readout. **Declining is what guarantees the readout never reaches the network** — turning 3D terrain on makes the remote lookup rare, but does not by itself rule it out. Decline and the readout still works wherever terrain can answer. While a lookup is in flight the readout is blank rather than showing the previous point's height.

!!! tip "Reading elevation along a line"
    For a profile rather than a single point, use the Elevation Profile plugin, or the [Measure tool](map-controls.md#component-tools), which reports terrain-aware 3D distances.

## Theme

Use the sun/moon button on the toolbar to switch between light and dark themes. The theme also follows your operating system preference by default, and you can set it for embeds with the `theme=dark` or `theme=light` URL parameter. See [Embedding & Sharing](embedding.md).

## Desktop and browser

The same UI runs as an installed desktop app (built with Tauri) and as a web app in the browser. The browser build covers most workflows, but features that need the local filesystem (file dialogs, local MBTiles and raster reads, project save/open, and the Python sidecar tools) require the desktop app. Each affected page notes these differences. See [Getting Started](../getting-started.md) for installation and [Downloads](../downloads.md) for installers.
