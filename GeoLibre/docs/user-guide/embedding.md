# Embedding & Sharing

GeoLibre's browser build can be embedded in any web page and configured through URL query parameters. This is how you turn a shared project into a live, focused map for a website, a report, or a dashboard.

## The live viewer

The browser build is hosted at `https://web.geolibre.app/`. It is a static site deployed on GitHub Pages that runs entirely in your browser: there is no server account, and the data you load is processed client-side. The hosted site counts page visits with Google Analytics, which never sees the data you load (see the [Privacy Policy](../privacy.md#website-analytics)); a copy you host yourself has no analytics at all. Data leaves your browser only when you add a remote URL or explicitly share a project.

Open a public project by passing its `.geolibre.json` URL with the `url` parameter:

```text
https://web.geolibre.app/?url=https://share.geolibre.app/giswqs/3d-tiles.geolibre.json
```

A project URL like this comes from **Project → Share**. See [Projects](projects.md#share).

A chrome-free `maponly` embed shows only the map, as in this shared 3D Tiles project:

## URL parameters

| Parameter    | Example                                                    | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`        | `url=https://share.geolibre.app/you/project.geolibre.json` | Loads a `.geolibre.json` project from a public URL.                                                                                   |
| `loading`    | `loading=true` | Exposes screenshot readiness on the document element. Accepts a bare flag, `true`, `1`, `yes`, or `on`; disabled by default. See below. |
| `data`       | `data=https://assets.geolibre.app/data/places.geojson`     | Loads public GeoJSON, GeoParquet, PMTiles, a COG, or a ZIP/REST response containing multiple GeoJSON files.                           |
| `style`      | `style=https://assets.geolibre.app/data/sample.style.json` | Applies a GeoLibre/MapLibre vector style or raster-style JSON to the data loaded by `data`.                                            |
| `layout`     | `layout=viewer`                                            | `viewer` provides read-only chrome: Layers, View, Controls, basemaps, search/identify, Help, and any quick filters the project's layers carry, with authoring UI hidden. `compact` is the icon-only full-app layout; `embed` and `iframe` are aliases. |
| `toolbar`    | `toolbar=none`                                             | Hides the top toolbar while keeping panels and the status bar. Use `icons` for icon-only buttons; `icon` and `icon-only` are aliases. `hidden`, `hide`, and `off` are aliases for `none`. |
| `panels`     | `panels=collapsed`                                         | Starts Layers and Style collapsed to their icon rails. Use `none` to hide all panels; `hidden`, `hide`, and `off` are aliases.         |
| `hidePanels` | `hidePanels=true`                                          | Alternative way to hide those panels.                                                                                                 |
| `maponly`    | `maponly`                                                  | Hides all chrome (toolbar, panels, and status bar), leaving only the map. The bare flag or `true`, `1`, `yes`, `on` enable it.        |
| `welcome`    | `welcome=0`                                                | Hides the first-launch welcome wizard. Accepts `0`, `false`, `off`, or `no`. A `url=` or `data=` deep link already suppresses it automatically. |
| `theme`      | `theme=dark`                                               | Sets the initial color theme, overriding the OS preference. Accepts `dark` or `light`; the in-app toggle still works afterward.       |
| `settingsUrl` | `settingsUrl=https://example.com/desktop-settings.json`   | Loads shared presentation settings before the first render. Supports `language`, `layout`, accent `theme`, and `uiProfile`. The override lasts for this page only and does not replace locally saved settings. `settingUrl` is accepted as an alias. |
| `tool`       | `tool=adaptive_filter`                                     | Opens the Processing (Whitebox toolbox) dialog on a specific tool by its id. Unknown ids open the dialog without preselecting a tool. |

!!! note "Private projects and data"
    `url=` and `data=` are fetched by the browser with same-origin credentials,
    so a project or dataset gated by a session cookie loads only when GeoLibre is
    served from that same origin. Passing a login-protected URL to the hosted
    viewer at `web.geolibre.app` fails, because the cookie is not sent
    cross-origin. Serve the app from your own host, or use a signed, expiring
    URL. See [Self-Hosting & Private Data](../self-hosting.md).

Parameters combine. For a narrow, chrome-free, dark embed of a shared project:

```text
https://web.geolibre.app/?url=https://share.geolibre.app/you/project.geolibre.json&maponly&theme=dark
```

The settings document must be public or same-origin, return valid JSON, and
allow cross-origin browser requests when hosted elsewhere. Its supported fields
use the same shape as their counterparts in the `geolibre.desktopSettings`
local-storage value. Credential-bearing fields, plugin sources, local startup
paths, and update settings are ignored. Missing or invalid fields are replaced
with GeoLibre defaults. If the document fails to load within ten seconds,
GeoLibre starts with the visitor's local settings. The `locale` and `lang` URL
parameters take precedence over a shared `language`. Other embed parameters,
including `theme`, `layout`, and `maponly`, independently control the initial
light/dark mode and chrome rather than the desktop accent and panel preferences.

Encode the settings URL with `encodeURIComponent` when it contains `&`, `+`,
`%`, or `#`, just as for a nested `data` URL.

### Deep-linking a Processing tool

`tool=<id>` opens the Processing (Whitebox toolbox) dialog preselected to a tool.
Any **additional** query parameters pre-fill that tool's form, using the tool's
own parameter names, so a link can arrive ready to run:

```text
https://web.geolibre.app/?tool=extract_cog_subset&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdata.source.coop%2Fgiswqs%2Fopengeos%2Fdem.tif&bbox_crs=4326
```

When `tool=` is present the app is in **tool mode**: `url` names a tool input
(here, the COG to subset) rather than a project to load, so the project loader
stands down. App/embed parameters above (`theme`, `layout`, `panels`, `maponly`,
`locale`, …) keep their own meaning and are never passed to the tool.
Preselection and parameter prefilling apply only to an id that matches the
Processing menu: an id not in the menu still opens the dialog, but without
preselecting a tool or applying any parameters. A known id the current engine
doesn't expose (WASM in the browser, the Python sidecar on desktop) likewise
isn't preselected. Tool ids match the Processing menu — the same ids used across
the [Whitebox toolbox](processing.md).

## Waiting for a screenshot

Add `&loading=true` to a project link to enable a machine-readable readiness
signal without adding a visible overlay to the screenshot:

```text
https://web.geolibre.app/?url=https://share.geolibre.app/giswqs/national-land-cover-database-nlcd.geolibre.json&maponly&loading=true
```

The `<html>` element exposes three attributes:

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `data-geolibre-load-state` | `loading`, `ready`, or `error` |
| `data-geolibre-load-pending` | JSON array of pending layer names (or initialization work) |
| `data-geolibre-load-errors` | JSON array of failure messages |

`ready` means the project/data URL has loaded, visible layers have attached,
their current-viewport tiles have loaded, the camera has stopped, and browser
fonts have loaded. These checks must remain satisfied for 500 ms across animation
frames. Changing the view or layers returns the signal to `loading`. Hidden
layers (including hidden groups), fully transparent layers, and layers outside
their zoom range do not block readiness. This does not download an entire
dataset or tiles outside the viewport.

The check supports native MapLibre layers, the raster control's COG layers, and
deck.gl visualization layers, including their shared deck.gl renderer. Custom
renderers without a readiness probe, such as Cesium, LiDAR, Zarr, splats, and
video, report an explicit error instead of assuming they are ready. A map or
tile failure the map recovers from does not block `ready`; one it never
recovers from is reported alongside the timeout, as is any loading that does
not settle within 120 seconds. Check the
errors before capturing; neither the embed API's `ready` event nor a browser's
`networkidle` state establishes this rendering readiness.

For example, with Playwright:

```javascript
await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1600, height: 1000 });
await page.goto(projectLink + "&maponly&loading=true");
await page.waitForFunction(
  () => ["ready", "error"].includes(document.documentElement.dataset.geolibreLoadState),
  undefined,
  { timeout: 150_000 },
);
const result = await page.evaluate(() => ({
  state: document.documentElement.dataset.geolibreLoadState,
  errors: JSON.parse(document.documentElement.dataset.geolibreLoadErrors || "[]"),
}));
if (result.state !== "ready") throw new Error(result.errors.join("; "));
await page.screenshot({ path: "map.png" });
```

## Embedding in a page

Drop the viewer into an `<iframe>`:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://web.geolibre.app/?url=https://share.geolibre.app/you/project.geolibre.json&amp;maponly"
  title="GeoLibre map"
  width="100%"
  height="600"
  style="border: 0;"
  loading="lazy"
  allow="fullscreen; geolocation"
></iframe>
```

Use `toolbar=none` to hide the top toolbar while retaining the configured side
panels and status bar. Use `layout=viewer` for a read-only map with layer toggles, search/identify, and
basemap switching. Its layer list mirrors the authoring Layers panel, folders
and all, so group names carry over, and a layer that carries
[quick filters](styling.md#quick-filters) shows them below its row so the map
can be questioned as well as read. The Controls menu is part of the viewer
chrome, minus the two entries that write to the project (Field Collection and
GPS Tracking); Record Tour and Record Video only read the map, so they stay.
Read-only covers the keyboard too: the
project shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+N, +O, +S) and the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd+K) go
with the menus they belong to, while the View shortcuts (`[`, `]`, `n`, `u`,
`r`) keep working since the View menu stays. Dropping a file onto the map
imports nothing, and the plugins whose on-map control writes to the project —
the geometry editor, Annotations, and GeoAgent — cannot be active, even if the
loaded project saved them that way.
So an embed cannot be steered into authoring by a key press, a drag, or a
project file. Display plugins (layer control, basemaps, time slider, legend and
colorbar components) keep working, so the project still looks as it was saved. Use `layout=compact` for the complete authoring
toolbar in a smaller space, or `maponly` for a pure map.

## Open remote data

Use `data` to open public GeoJSON, GeoParquet, PMTiles, Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG), a LiDAR point cloud (LAS, LAZ, COPC, or an EPT `ept.json`), or a ZIP archive containing one or more `.geojson`/`.json` FeatureCollections. Each GeoJSON file in a ZIP becomes a separate layer. An optional `style` URL applies Mapbox/MapLibre style JSON to vector data:

```text
https://web.geolibre.app/?data=https://assets.geolibre.app/data/places.geojson&style=https://assets.geolibre.app/data/sample.style.json
```

Repeat `data` to load multiple independent datasets on the same map. Repeat
`style` in the same order to style each dataset; use an empty `style=` as a
placeholder when an earlier dataset should use its default style:

```text
https://web.geolibre.app/?data=https://example.com/roads.geojson&data=https://example.com/dem.tif&style=&style=https://example.com/dem.style.json
```

GeoLibre loads every entry and fits the map once to their combined stored
extents. A style applies only to the `data` value at the same position.

`data` may also point to a REST API endpoint that returns either a GeoJSON `FeatureCollection` or a ZIP containing multiple GeoJSON files. ZIP API responses are recognized from their `Content-Type`/`Content-Disposition` headers or their ZIP file signature, so the endpoint does not need a `.zip` suffix. An endpoint that takes its own query parameters is the case that does need percent-encoding, so its `&` separators are not read as GeoLibre's own:

```text
https://web.geolibre.app/?data=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.example.com%2Ffeatures%3Fcategory%3Dparks%26limit%3D100
```

The example API URL is illustrative. Use the hosted `places.geojson` example above for a directly runnable test.

A hosted ZIP with per-file styles can be tested directly:

```text
https://web.geolibre.app/?data=https://assets.geolibre.app/data/multiple-layers.zip&style=https://assets.geolibre.app/data/multiple-layers.style.json
```

GeoParquet is loaded through GeoLibre's DuckDB-backed vector reader. PMTiles is streamed with HTTP range requests and may contain either vector or raster tiles. These real vector examples also apply the hosted sample style:

```text
https://web.geolibre.app/?data=https://data.source.coop/giswqs/opengeos/building_count_h3.parquet&style=https://assets.geolibre.app/data/sample.style.json
```

```text
https://web.geolibre.app/?data=https://data.source.coop/giswqs/opengeos/building_count_h3.pmtiles&style=https://assets.geolibre.app/data/sample.style.json
```

For a vector PMTiles archive, the style is applied to the layer after the archive's source layers are discovered. A raster PMTiles archive can be loaded with `data`, but it does not accept a MapLibre vector style through `style`.

A public DEM COG can be tested directly:

```text
https://web.geolibre.app/?data=https://data.source.coop/giswqs/opengeos/dem.tif
```

A LiDAR point cloud opens in the LiDAR layer control. A COPC file (`.copc.laz`) or an EPT dataset (`ept.json`) streams the points in view on demand; a plain LAS or LAZ file is downloaded whole, and is refused if its server reports it larger than 250 MB (convert a larger file to COPC to stream it). A point cloud does not take a `style`:

```text
https://web.geolibre.app/?data=https://s3.amazonaws.com/hobu-lidar/autzen-classified.copc.laz
```

GeoLibre recognizes a point cloud from its URL path. An API endpoint whose path has no `.las`/`.laz` suffix, such as `https://api.example.com/download/42?token=…`, needs `dataType=lidar` to say what it returns. Like `style`, `dataType` pairs with `data` by position, so repeat it (leaving earlier values empty) in a batch. A hinted endpoint is downloaded whole, since COPC streaming is chosen only for a `.copc.` URL. An access token passed in the query string is kept on every request, including the byte-range reads of a streamed COPC file; encode the whole `data` value when the endpoint has more than one query parameter:

```text
https://web.geolibre.app/?data=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.example.com%2Fdownload%2F42%3Ftoken%3Dabc%26expires%3D3600&dataType=lidar
```

A plain `https://…` URL can be passed as-is, as above: `:` and `/` are legal in a query value and need no escaping. Encode the nested data and style URLs with `encodeURIComponent` only when they contain a character that would be read as GeoLibre's own query syntax — `&`, `+`, `%`, or `#`. A bare `=` inside the value is fine, since only the first `=` in each `&`-delimited pair separates the name from the value. Remote servers must permit browser cross-origin requests (CORS). COG, GeoParquet, PMTiles, and COPC servers should also support HTTP byte-range requests.

For a COG, `style` may point to a raster style JSON object. Supported fields are `mode` (`single`, `rgb`, or `index`), 1-based `bands`, `rescale` ranges, `colormap`, `reversed`, `nodata`, `opacity`, `gamma`, `stretch` (`linear`, `log`, or `sqrt`), and the normalized-difference `index` preset. For example:

```json
{
  "mode": "single",
  "bands": [1],
  "rescale": [[0, 1000]],
  "colormap": "viridis",
  "reversed": false,
  "nodata": "auto",
  "opacity": 0.85,
  "gamma": 1,
  "stretch": "linear"
}
```

After hosting that JSON as `dem.style.json`, pass both URLs:

```text
https://web.geolibre.app/?data=https://data.source.coop/giswqs/opengeos/dem.tif&style=https://assets.geolibre.app/data/dem.style.json
```

For a ZIP containing files of the same geometry type, assign different styles by setting each Mapbox style layer's `source` to the corresponding filename stem. For example, `source: "parks"` targets `parks.geojson`, while `source: "counties"` targets `counties.geojson`. Style layers without a `source` are shared by every imported file. GeoLibre validates all filename/style matches before adding any ZIP layers.

You do not need to author that JSON by hand. Open the vector layer's **Layer actions → Styles → Export GeoLibre URL style** menu. The downloaded `.geolibre.style.json` contains only symbology—not feature data—and its render-layer `source` is already set to the original GeoJSON filename stem. Host the file on a CORS-enabled server and pass its URL as `style` alongside the corresponding `data` URL. For a multi-file ZIP, export each layer's GeoLibre URL style and combine their `layers` and `sources` into one style document; layers without `source` can be used for rules shared by every ZIP member.

The same file can be applied interactively to an existing vector layer through **Layer actions → Styles → Import style from file (GeoLibre URL / Mapbox GL / SLD / QML)…**. Interactive import ignores the file's query-param `source` binding and applies its supported symbology to the layer you selected, so the data filename does not need to match.

### An "Open in GeoLibre" badge

If you publish a dataset — in a repository README, a data catalog, a paper's
supplementary material — an **Open in GeoLibre** badge turns it into a one-click
interactive map. Copy one of these and swap in your own URL:

[![Open in GeoLibre](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-GeoLibre-green.svg)](https://web.geolibre.app/?data=https://assets.geolibre.app/data/places.geojson)

```markdown
[![Open in GeoLibre](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-GeoLibre-green.svg)](https://web.geolibre.app/?data=https://assets.geolibre.app/data/places.geojson)
```

The same badge can open a shared project instead of a single file, using `url`:

```markdown
[![Open in GeoLibre](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-GeoLibre-green.svg)](https://web.geolibre.app/?url=https://share.geolibre.app/you/project.geolibre.json)
```

In reStructuredText:

```rst
.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-GeoLibre-green.svg
   :target: https://web.geolibre.app/?data=https://assets.geolibre.app/data/places.geojson
   :alt: Open in GeoLibre
```

In HTML:

```html
<a href="https://web.geolibre.app/?data=https://assets.geolibre.app/data/places.geojson">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-GeoLibre-green.svg" alt="Open in GeoLibre" />
</a>
```

Add any of the [URL parameters](#url-parameters) to the link to control how the
map opens — `&style=` for symbology, `&theme=dark`, or `&maponly` for a
chrome-free view.

One caveat specific to badges: a badge lives in a `README.md` that GitHub, PyPI,
and docs sites all render, and each of those rewrites relative links
differently, so keep the target URL **absolute**. The encoding rule above
applies unchanged — a data URL carrying its own query string still needs
`encodeURIComponent`, because the `&` is read as GeoLibre's own separator well
before the browser ever sees it.

## Talking to the map at runtime

URL parameters configure the app once, at load. To keep talking to a **live**
embed (fly to the record the user just clicked in your app, highlight it, open a
processing tool) and to hear what the user does inside the map, use the embed
`postMessage` API. The dependency-free `@geolibre/embed` package provides the
recommended typed client and handles origin checks and request correlation:

```ts
import { connect } from "@geolibre/embed";

const map = await connect(document.querySelector("iframe"), {
  origin: "https://web.geolibre.app",
});
await map.setView({ center: [-95.7, 37.1], zoom: 5 });
await map.setLayerVisibility("roads", false);
const added = await map.addData("https://assets.geolibre.app/data/places.geojson");
const layers = await map.listLayers();
map.on("selectionChanged", ({ featureIds }) => console.log(featureIds));
```

### Enabling it

The API is **off by default**: a public deployment can never be driven by the
page that frames it. Turn it on by naming the origins you trust. For the Docker
image, that is one environment variable:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 \
  -e GEOLIBRE_EMBED_ORIGINS="https://portal.example.com,https://erp.example.com" \
  ghcr.io/opengeos/geolibre:latest
```

For a static build, bake it in instead:
`VITE_GEOLIBRE_EMBED_ORIGINS="https://portal.example.com" npm run build`.

Entries are origins (`scheme://host[:port]`); a trailing path is ignored. `*`
allows any origin and is only appropriate on a private network. The allowlist is
enforced in both directions: a message from an unlisted origin is ignored, and
every message the app sends is addressed to a listed origin. (With `*`
configured, outbound messages are addressed to `*` until the host's first
message identifies it, which is one more reason to name your origins.)

Setting the allowlist also narrows the `?embed=1` project/scripting bridges (used
by the [Python package](../python.md)) to the same origins. As extra hardening
you can stop other sites from framing the app at all by adding
`Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors <your origins>` at your reverse proxy.

The allowlist decides *who* may send commands. To narrow *which* commands exist
at all — so a trusted host page still cannot turn the embed into a
general-purpose data-fetching proxy — build with
[deployment capabilities](../deployment-capabilities.md). A denied command
rejects with `Missing <capability> capability` rather than silently doing
nothing: `loadProject` needs `project:edit`, `addLayer` and `addData` need
`data:add`, `openTool` needs `processing:run`, and `exportImage` needs
`export:data`. The rest — `setView`, `highlight`, layer visibility — are
unprivileged and always available.

### The typed client

`@geolibre/embed` is a dependency-free ESM package published to npm from each
GeoLibre release, so its version tracks the app version:

```bash
npm install @geolibre/embed
```

`connect(iframe, options)` returns a promise that resolves once the app sends
`ready`, so there is no `ready` handshake to write yourself. It also stamps a
`requestId` on every command and settles that command's promise from the
matching `ack`, which is what lets several commands be in flight at once
without their answers getting crossed.

```ts
import { connect } from "@geolibre/embed";

const map = await connect(iframe, {
  origin: "https://web.geolibre.app", // exact origin hosting the iframe
  timeoutMs: 15_000, // wait for `ready`; default 15s
  requestTimeoutMs: 15_000, // wait for each `ack`; default 15s
});
```

`origin` is required and must be an `http(s)` origin: it is both the target of
every outbound message and the filter on inbound ones, so a message from any
other frame or origin is ignored. Pass the *app's* origin, not your own.

| `setFilter(layerId, expression)`       | `void`                  | A MapLibre filter expression, or `null` to clear it.                    |
| `getViewport()`                        | `Viewport`              | `{ bbox, center, zoom, bearing, pitch }`.                               |
| `addLayer(spec)`                       | the new layer's `id`    | Takes a project-format layer specification.                             |
| `addData(url, options?)`               | the new layer `id`s     | Loads remote data like `?data=`; options are `{ styleUrl, fit }`.        |
| `exportImage()`                        | a PNG `data:` URL       | The map as currently rendered.                                          |
| `on(event, listener)`                  | an unsubscribe function | Not a promise; events are the set the app posts (see below).            |
| `disconnect()`                         | not a promise           | Removes the listener and rejects anything still in flight.              |

Every command rejects rather than resolving falsely: an `ack` carrying
`ok: false` rejects with the app's own error message, and a command with no
answer inside `requestTimeoutMs` rejects with a timeout. `connect` itself
rejects if `ready` does not arrive inside `timeoutMs` — most often because the
deployment has not allowlisted your origin, or because `origin` does not match
the iframe.

Call `disconnect()` when you tear the iframe down (a React effect cleanup, a
route change). It stops the `message` listener and rejects every pending
command, so a promise cannot hang for the life of the page.

`on` returns its own unsubscribe function and accepts every event in the table
[below](#geolibre-to-host), typed by name. Subscribing to `ack` is only worth it
to observe the traffic, since each command's promise is already settled from it.

Hosts that cannot take a dependency can speak the protocol directly; the rest of
this page documents it.

### Message shape

Every message, in both directions, is versioned:

```json
{ "v": 2, "type": "setView", "payload": { "center": [-95.7, 37.1], "zoom": 5 } }
```

Messages the **app** sends also carry `"source": "geolibre"`, so you can filter
them out of the other `postMessage` traffic on your page.

### Host to GeoLibre

| Type               | Payload                                                    | Effect                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `loadProject`      | `{ url }`                                                  | Loads a `.geolibre.json` project without reloading the iframe.                      |
| `setView`          | `{ bbox }` or `{ center, zoom, bearing, pitch, duration }` | Fits a bounding box, or flies the camera to the properties you send.                |
| `highlightFeature` | `{ layerId, featureId \| featureIds \| filter, fit }`      | Selects and highlights features; `filter` matches properties. `fit` zooms to them.  |
| `openTool`         | `{ id, params }`                                           | Opens the Processing dialog on a tool, pre-filling `params`. Runtime twin of `?tool=`. |
| `setLayerVisibility` | `{ layerId, visible }`                                   | Shows or hides a project layer.                                                       |
| `listLayers`       | `{}`                                                       | Returns layer summaries in the acknowledgement's `result`.                           |
| `setFilter`        | `{ layerId, expression }`                                  | Applies a MapLibre filter expression; send `null` to clear it.                        |
| `getViewport`      | `{}`                                                       | Returns the current camera and bounds in `result`.                                    |
| `addLayer`         | `{ spec }`                                                 | Adds a project-format layer specification at runtime.                                 |
| `addData`          | `{ url, styleUrl?, fit? }`                                 | Loads GeoJSON/API, ZIP, GeoParquet, PMTiles, or COG data without reloading the iframe. |
| `exportImage`      | `{}`                                                       | Returns the rendered map as a PNG data URL in `result`.                               |

Send `{ layerId }` alone to `highlightFeature` to clear the highlight. A request
that names features (or a filter) but matches none is rejected rather than
treated as a clear, so a mistyped id does not silently wipe the user's selection.
Highlighting reads the layer's features from the project, so it applies to vector
layers GeoLibre holds as GeoJSON, not to ones whose features live only in a tile
source.

`setFilter` compiles the expression through the MapLibre style spec before
storing it, and `addLayer` requires a source the map can actually read: a `url`
or a non-empty `tiles`, or — for the two layer types drawn from inline features,
`geojson` and `deckgl-viz` — an inline `geojson`. Both report the problem in the
`ack` rather than reporting success and rendering nothing. `addLayer` also
refuses `javascript:`, `vbscript:`, `data:`, `file:`, and `blob:` URLs on a
source; a custom map protocol such as `pmtiles://` is fine.

`addData` uses the same format detection, CORS requirements, safety limits, and
optional Mapbox/MapLibre style import as the [`data` URL parameter](#open-remote-data).
It fits the newly loaded data by default; pass `fit: false` to preserve the
current camera. Its acknowledgement returns every created layer id, including
all layers extracted from a ZIP archive.

Add a `requestId` to any message and the app answers with an `ack` (below)
reporting whether it worked.

| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ready`             | `{ version }`                                                  | The app has mounted and is listening.                             |
| `ack`               | `{ requestId, ok, error, result }`                             | A message you sent with a `requestId` was applied (or rejected).  |
| `projectLoaded`     | `{ url, name, layerIds }`                                      | A project finished loading, whoever started it.                   |
| `selectionChanged`  | `{ layerId, featureIds }`                                      | The user (or your `highlightFeature`) changed the selection.      |
| `viewChanged`       | `{ bbox, center, zoom, bearing, pitch }`                       | The camera moved (throttled to about four events a second).       |
| `toolCompleted`     | `{ id, name, status, engine, durationMs, outputLayerNames }`   | A processing run finished, successfully or not.                   |
| `serverFileWritten` | `{ path, toolId }`                                             | A file-based tool wrote an output (conversion and raster tools).  |

### A host page

```html
<iframe
  id="map"
  src="https://gis.example.com/?url=https://erp.example.com/fields.geolibre.json&maponly"
  title="GeoLibre map"
  width="100%"
  height="600"
  style="border: 0"
></iframe>

<script>
  const frame = document.getElementById("map");
  const APP_ORIGIN = "https://gis.example.com";

  const send = (type, payload) =>
    frame.contentWindow.postMessage({ v: 2, type, payload }, APP_ORIGIN);

  window.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
    if (event.origin !== APP_ORIGIN) return;
    const message = event.data;
    if (message?.source !== "geolibre" || message.v !== 2) return;

    if (message.type === "ready") {
      // Safe to start sending commands.
    } else if (message.type === "selectionChanged") {
      showRecordFor(message.payload.featureIds[0]);
    }
  });

  // Click a record in your own UI: fly to it and highlight it, no reload.
  function focusField(field) {
    send("setView", { bbox: field.bbox });
    send("highlightFeature", {
      layerId: "fields",
      filter: { parcel_id: field.id },
      fit: true,
    });
  }
</script>
```

Wait for `ready` before sending: messages that arrive before the app has mounted
are not queued. Treat `ready` as idempotent, since it is re-sent whenever the app
remounts (a navigation inside the frame, a development hot reload).

Protocol v2 is current. GeoLibre continues to accept v1 request envelopes and
answers a v1 host with v1 events, so existing hand-written integrations remain
compatible.

## What works in an embed

The browser build supports map navigation, browser-selected and URL-based data, styling, the SQL Workspace, and most plugins. Desktop-only features (local file dialogs, local MBTiles and raster reads, project save/open, and the Python sidecar tools) are not available in an embed. See [Getting Started](../getting-started.md).

See the [Sharing & Embedding tutorial](../tutorials/sharing-embedding.md) for a full walkthrough.

## Switching renderers

```javascript
client.on("rendererchange", ({ renderer }) => console.log(renderer));
await client.setRenderer("cesium");
const renderer = await client.getRenderer();
```

Both methods accept or return `"maplibre"`, `"mapbox"`, `"cesium"`, or
`"arcgis"`. The change event reports
the selected renderer. `setRenderer` acknowledges the selection; the new canvas
mounts asynchronously. Wait for the next `ready` event before issuing camera or
capture commands. `exportImage()` supports all four renderers and waits for the
visible layers to settle before returning a PNG data URL.
