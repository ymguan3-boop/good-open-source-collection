# AI Segmentation

**Processing → GeoLibre Toolbox → AI Segmentation** turns imagery into vector features
using [segment-geospatial](https://github.com/opengeos/segment-geospatial)
(SamGeo) and Meta's **SAM 3** model. Describe what you want — *"trees"*,
*"buildings"*, *"water"* — or run automatic segmentation, and GeoLibre adds the
resulting polygons as a new vector layer.

!!! note "Requires the Python sidecar and a model backend"
    Segmentation runs deep-learning models, so it needs the GeoLibre desktop
    app with the Python sidecar **plus** a running `samgeo-api` model server. A
    CUDA GPU is strongly recommended; CPU inference works but is slow. See
    [Setup](#setup) below.

## How it works

The heavy model stack (PyTorch + SAM 3) does **not** run inside the GeoLibre
sidecar. Instead the sidecar exposes a thin `/ml` reverse-proxy in front of a
separate **`samgeo-api`** server (the REST server shipped with
`segment-geospatial`). GeoLibre uploads the image to the sidecar, which forwards
it to `samgeo-api`, runs SAM 3, and returns GeoJSON polygons.

```text
SegmentationDialog ──image+prompt──▶ sidecar /ml/segment/* ──▶ samgeo-api (SAM 3) ──▶ GeoJSON
```

This keeps the GeoLibre sidecar small and lets the model server run wherever you
have a GPU.

## Setup

Install `segment-geospatial` with the API and SAM 3 extras in a Python
environment that has a working PyTorch build (ideally CUDA):

```bash
pip install "segment-geospatial[api,samgeo3]"
```

Then either let GeoLibre launch the model server for you, or run it yourself:

- **Auto-launch (default).** If `samgeo-api` is on the `PATH` of the environment
  the sidecar runs in, GeoLibre starts it automatically on first use.
- **Run it yourself / on another machine.** Start the server and point GeoLibre
  at it:

    ```bash
    samgeo-api --port 8000
    # then run the sidecar with:
    GEOLIBRE_ML_SAMGEO_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
    ```

!!! note "Desktop app: point it at an external `samgeo-api`"

    The desktop app runs its sidecar in a managed (uv) environment that ships
    the `ml` extra but **not** the heavy `segment-geospatial` model stack, so
    `samgeo-api` is not on its `PATH` and auto-launch does not apply. Install
    `segment-geospatial[api,samgeo3]` in a PyTorch-capable environment, start
    `samgeo-api` there, and launch the desktop app from a shell that exports
    `GEOLIBRE_ML_SAMGEO_URL` so the sidecar proxies to it:

    ```bash
    # in your PyTorch env
    samgeo-api --port 8000

    # launch the desktop app with the proxy target set
    GEOLIBRE_ML_SAMGEO_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 npm run tauri:dev
    ```

    The Tauri process passes its environment to the sidecar it spawns. Without
    `GEOLIBRE_ML_SAMGEO_URL`, the sidecar has no model backend and `/ml/status`
    reports the segmentation backend as unavailable.

Install the sidecar's optional `ml` extra (just an HTTP client — the models live
in `samgeo-api`):

```bash
pip install -e "backend/geolibre_server[ml]"
```

### Configuration

| Environment variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GEOLIBRE_ML_SAMGEO_URL` | Base URL of an already-running `samgeo-api`. When set, the sidecar proxies here and does not launch a child process. |
| `GEOLIBRE_ML_SAMGEO_CMD` | Command used to launch `samgeo-api` on demand (default `samgeo-api`). `--host`/`--port` are appended automatically. |
| `GEOLIBRE_ML_DEFAULT_MODEL` | Model the UI defaults to (default `sam3`). |

## Using it

1. Open **Processing → GeoLibre Toolbox → AI Segmentation**.
2. If the backend isn't reachable, the dialog shows a message and a **Start
   server** button (desktop) — click it to launch the sidecar and model server.
3. **Choose a GeoTIFF.** Pick a georeferenced raster (`.tif`/`.tiff`; PNG/JPG
   also work but produce pixel-space results). The polygons come back in the
   raster's coordinate system, so they land in the right place on the map.
4. **Pick a mode:**
    - **Text prompt** — type what to segment (e.g. `trees`, `buildings`,
      `cars`) and set a **Confidence threshold** (0–1; lower finds more, higher
      is stricter). SAM 3 finds every matching object in the image.
    - **Automatic (everything)** — segments all distinct objects without a
      prompt.
5. Click **Segment**. The result is added as a new GeoJSON polygon layer named
   after the prompt, and the map zooms to it.

## Notes & limitations

- **SAM 3 only.** GeoLibre uses the SAM 3 backend, which covers text, box/point,
  and automatic prompts well. (SAM 2 is intentionally not wired up.)
- **Desktop only.** Like the raster tools, segmentation needs the desktop app
  and the Python sidecar; it is not available in the browser-only build.
- **No objects found** is a normal outcome — try a different prompt or lower the
  confidence threshold.
- **Box / point prompts** drawn on the map are available in the interactive
  [SamGeo plugin](#interactive-samgeo-plugin) below; this dialog covers text and
  automatic modes only.

## Interactive SamGeo plugin

**Plugins → SamGeo** opens a dockable panel that talks to `samgeo-api`
directly (default `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, editable in the panel) rather than
through the sidecar, so it works in the browser build as well as on desktop.
It mirrors `segment-geospatial`'s own interactive map: one uploaded image is
shared by every prompt type, and results land as GeoJSON polygon layers.

1. Start the model server (`samgeo-api --port 8000`; the panel links to the
   [setup guide](https://samgeo.gishub.org/api/)) and click **Check
   connection**.
2. **Choose the image.** *Image source* lists every COG or GeoTIFF layer
   already on the map — pick one to segment it in place — or leave it on
   **Upload a file** and choose a local `.tif`/`.png`/`.jpg`. The
   **Aerial imagery (UC Berkeley)** sample in *Add Data → Raster Layer* is a
   good first image.
3. **Pick a mode:**
    - **Text prompt** — a concept such as `building` or `tree`, with a
      confidence threshold and mask-size limits.
    - **Point prompts** — click **+ Foreground point** / **− Background
      point**, then click the map; green and red markers show the prompts.
      At least one foreground point is required.
    - **Bounding box (find similar)** — click **Draw box on map** and drag a
      rectangle; SAM 3 returns every object that resembles the boxed one.
    - **Automatic (everything)** — segments all distinct objects. SAM 3 is a
      prompt-driven model, so this mode runs SAM 2's automatic mask generator
      instead (choose the checkpoint under *SAM2 model*; `points_per_side`,
      IoU and stability thresholds apply here).
4. Click **Segment**. Polygons are reprojected from the raster's CRS to WGS84
   and added as a layer named after the prompt or mode; the map zooms to it.
   With `segment-geospatial` 1.4.2 or newer each feature carries a `score`
   attribute with the model's confidence, visible in the attribute table.

Use **Clear prompts** to remove the points or box. Switching modes clears the
other mode's prompts, and closing the panel removes the on-map prompt overlay.
The panel's settings (API URL, mode, model, thresholds) persist with the
project.

!!! note "Image uploads go to the API URL you configure"
    The image is POSTed to the configured server. A project file can carry a
    saved API URL, so check the field before segmenting a local image with a
    project you did not author.

## API (advanced)

The sidecar exposes these endpoints (proxied to `samgeo-api`):

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/ml/status` | Backend availability, default model, version, and model list. |
| POST | `/ml/segment/text` | Text-prompt segmentation (`prompt`, `confidence_threshold`). |
| POST | `/ml/segment/automatic` | Automatic mask generation. |
| POST | `/ml/segment/predict` | Box/point prompt segmentation (`boxes`, `point_coords`, `point_labels`, `point_crs`). |

Each `segment/*` endpoint takes a multipart `file` (the image) plus
`model_version` (default `sam3`) and `output_format` (default `geojson`) and
returns a GeoJSON `FeatureCollection`.
