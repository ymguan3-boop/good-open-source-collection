# Story Maps

Story maps turn a project into a scroll-driven narrative. As the reader scrolls,
the map flies between chapters, and project layers can fade in and out. The
feature is inspired by the
[maplibre-gl-storymaps](https://github.com/opengeos/maplibre-gl-storymaps)
template. Authoring and the in-app presentation run locally, though basemap
styles and any chapter images are still fetched from their URLs, and the
standalone HTML export loads MapLibre and scrollama from a CDN.

## Open the builder

Choose **Project → Story Map** to open the builder. The builder edits a story
that is saved inside the `.geolibre.json` project file, so it travels with your
project.

!!! tip "Try it instantly"
    When the story is empty, click **Load sample story** to populate a five-city
    world tour. Hit **Present** and scroll to see it in action, then edit or
    replace the chapters with your own.

## Story settings

- **Title / Subtitle / Byline / Footer** appear in the presentation header and
  footer. The footer accepts inline HTML (for example, links and credits).
- **Panel theme** switches the chapter panels between light and dark.
- **Show markers** drops a marker at each chapter's center; pick its color.
- **Inset minimap** shows a small overview map in a chosen corner.
- **Hide chapter list** removes the navigation pane from the presentation, for a
  story meant to be read straight through.
- **Enable start view** adds an opening screen before the first chapter, carrying
  the story's title block. Choose what the map shows behind it: an **Empty
  screen**, a **Black screen**, a **Global view**, or a **Preview of first
  chapter**.
- **Enable closing slide** adds a final screen after the last chapter, for
  credits or a closing note. The same backdrop choices apply, plus **Hold on last
  chapter** to leave the camera where the story ended.

## Chapters

Click **Add chapter** to capture the current map view as a new chapter. Each
chapter has:

- **Title**, **Description** (inline HTML allowed), and an optional **Image URL**.
- **Panel alignment**: `left`, `center`, `right`, or `full`.
- **Map animation**: `flyTo`, `easeTo`, or `jumpTo`.
- **Hide panel** keeps the map transition but hides the text (useful for a pure
  map beat).
- **Rotate camera** slowly spins the view after the transition settles.

Use **Set to current view** to re-capture the camera after panning, zooming, or
tilting the map, and the map-pin button to fly to a chapter while editing.
Reorder chapters with the arrows and remove them with the trash icon.

## Import and export chapters

To author content outside GeoLibre, use **Import** / **Export** next to **Add
chapter**:

- **Export JSON** writes the whole story (settings and chapters); **Import JSON**
  reads it back (a full `.geolibre.json` project file also works).
- **Export CSV** writes one row per chapter (spreadsheet-friendly). **Import CSV**
  replaces the chapters while keeping your current story settings.

The CSV columns are `id, title, description, image, alignment, hidden, lng, lat,
zoom, pitch, bearing, mapAnimation, rotateAnimation, onChapterEnter,
onChapterExit`. Columns are matched by name, so order is flexible and you only
need the ones you use; `lng`/`lat` set the chapter center, and missing ids are
generated on import. The `onChapterEnter`/`onChapterExit` columns hold JSON and
can be left blank when authoring by hand.

### Layer effects

Under **On enter** and **On exit**, add layer fades that run as a chapter
becomes active or is left behind. Pick a project layer and a target opacity (and
optional transition duration). This is how you reveal or hide data as the story
progresses.

## Present

Click **Present** to start the scroll-driven presentation over the live map.
Scroll to move between chapters; press **Esc** or **Exit** to return to editing.

![A story map in presentation mode, with the chapter navigation pane, a chapter card, and the inset minimap over the live map](https://assets.geolibre.app/images/geolibre-story-map-present.webp)

A **navigation pane** on the left lists every chapter for a quick overview;
click any entry to jump straight to it. Toggle the pane with the list button next
to **Exit**. The map controls (navigation, fullscreen, globe, layer control)
stay usable during the presentation.

Each chapter card is **movable and resizable**: drag its title bar to reposition
it (double-click the bar to reset), or drag the bottom-right corner to resize, so
you can move a card aside and explore the map beneath it.

## Handout (PDF)

Click **Handout (PDF)** to export the story as a multi-page PDF, one page per
screen. Pick which screens to include, the paper size and orientation, and the
document title, subtitle, byline, and footer text drawn on every page. Each
chapter page shows the captured map view, the chapter photo beside it when the
chapter has one, and the chapter description.

**Clickable location markers** draws a marker at each chapter's location, its
tip on the chapter coordinate. Opened in a PDF viewer, clicking a marker opens
that coordinate in Google Maps, so a reader can navigate to the place. The
marker takes the story's **Marker color**, and the option starts on when **Show
markers** is enabled for the story.

## Export to HTML

Click **Export HTML** to save a self-contained `.html` page that reproduces the
story without GeoLibre. In-memory GeoJSON layers referenced by chapter effects
are inlined so the exported story behaves like the in-app preview. The page is a
single static file you can host anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, S3, or any web
server).
