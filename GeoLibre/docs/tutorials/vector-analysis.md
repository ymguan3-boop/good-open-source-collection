# Vector Analysis

This tutorial runs a small vector workflow: buffer a layer, overlay it with another, and export the result. It uses the [Vector tools](../user-guide/processing.md#vector) under **Processing → GeoLibre Toolbox → Vector**.

![The Processing menu with GeoLibre Toolbox → Vector open on its Geometry, Overlay, Join, and Select groups](https://assets.geolibre.app/images/geolibre-toolbox-vector-menu.webp)

!!! note "Two toolboxes share this menu"
    **Processing → Vector** (above the separator) is the Whitebox catalog's vector category; **Processing → GeoLibre Toolbox → Vector** is the dialog this tutorial uses. See [Two toolboxes in one menu](../user-guide/processing.md#two-toolboxes-in-one-menu).

## 1. Load input data

Add at least one vector layer (see [Adding Data](../user-guide/adding-data.md)). For an overlay you will need two layers, for example a set of points or lines and a polygon layer to clip against.

## 2. Buffer a layer

1. Open **Processing → GeoLibre Toolbox → Vector → Buffer**.
2. Set **Input layer** to your layer.
3. Set the **Distance** and **Units** (kilometers, meters, or miles).
4. Choose an **Engine**:
   - **Client (Turf.js)** runs in the browser with no setup.
   - **Sidecar (GeoPandas)** runs on the Python sidecar for projection-aware distances (desktop app).
   - **Python (Pyodide)** runs the same GeoPandas code as the sidecar, but in your browser, so the results match the sidecar without one being installed. The runtime downloads once on first use.
5. Click **Run**. A buffered layer is added to the map.

!!! tip "Projection-aware distances"
    The client engine buffers in geographic coordinates. For accurate metric distances over large areas, use one of the two GeoPandas engines, which reproject before buffering: **Sidecar (GeoPandas)** on the desktop app, or **Python (Pyodide)** anywhere, including the web build.

## 3. Overlay two layers

With the buffer (or any polygon layer) and a second layer, run an overlay:

- **Clip** keeps the part of the input that falls inside the overlay, preserving the input's attributes.
- **Intersection** keeps only the overlapping areas of two polygon layers.
- **Difference** removes the overlay's area from the input.
- **Union** merges two polygon layers into one (attributes are not preserved, on either engine).
- **Spatial join** attaches a join layer's attributes to each input feature based on a spatial relationship (intersects, within, or contains) — for example, tagging each point with the polygon that contains it. Works with any geometry type.
- **Attribute join** attaches a join table's attributes to each input feature where a key field matches — no geometry involved (for example, joining census statistics to boundary polygons by a shared FIPS code). It is one-to-one (the first matching join row wins); pick the key field on each side, optionally list which fields to bring over, and choose an inner or left join.

Open the tool from **Processing → GeoLibre Toolbox → Vector**, pick the input and overlay layers, and **Run**.

## 4. Inspect and refine

Open the [Attribute table](../user-guide/attribute-table.md) on the result layer to check the output, and adjust its [style](../user-guide/styling.md) so it stands out from the inputs. Every run is also recorded in **Processing → History**, which re-runs an entry with one click and copies the equivalent Python code.

## 5. Export the result

To save the output as a cloud-native file, use **Processing → GeoLibre Toolbox → Conversion** (for example **Vector to GeoParquet** or **Vector to FlatGeobuf**). See [Cloud-Native Data](cloud-native-data.md). You can also export records from the [Attribute table](../user-guide/attribute-table.md) or the [SQL Workspace](../user-guide/sql-workspace.md).

## Next steps

- Do the same kind of analysis in SQL with [Spatial SQL](spatial-sql.md).
- Move to raster analysis in [Terrain Analysis](terrain-analysis.md).
