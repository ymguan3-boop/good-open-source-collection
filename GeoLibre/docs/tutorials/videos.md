The full introduction, and the best place to start. Installs and runs all three
builds — browser, desktop, and Jupyter — then works through projects, vector
and raster data, attribute and geometry editing, streaming a 180 GB dataset
without downloading it, PMTiles, 3D tiles, LiDAR, DuckDB, the map controls, and
sharing.

The Whitebox Next Gen toolbox running entirely on WebAssembly — terrain,
hydrology, LiDAR, remote sensing, raster, and vector tools, with nothing
installed. Walks the category-browsable Processing menu, runs terrain and
hydrology tools on a DEM, and covers plugins, large local files, and the
JupyterLite panel.

The toolbox has since grown past 1,000 tools; see
[Processing Tools](../user-guide/processing.md) for the current list.

build a 3D NYC map with extrusions and expression-driven styling, animate
building growth over time, then edit footprints and push the edits back to
GeoLens.

Build graphical, reusable geoprocessing workflows in the browser: a simple
vector chain first, then a full hydrology model that extracts a stream network
from a DEM. The second half hands the same job to the
[AI Assistant](../user-guide/ai-assistant.md), which assembles and wires the
model from a natural-language prompt, and shows how to edit what it produced.

GeoLibre uses COG, GeoParquet, PMTiles, DuckDB, and WebAssembly to work with
large vector, raster, and LiDAR datasets directly in the browser, then walks the
plugin ecosystem, the cross-platform builds (browser, desktop, mobile, Jupyter,
R), and the emerging GeoAI integration.

Georeferences a scanned University of Tennessee campus map with no desktop GIS:
place ground control points, pick a transformation, read the per-GCP and RMS
residuals, and align the image to a basemap. Then exports a GeoTIFF, reloads it,
handles NoData transparency, compares it against the basemap with the swipe
tool, and shares the finished map.
