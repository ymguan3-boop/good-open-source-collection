# Tutorials

These tutorials walk through common GeoLibre workflows end to end. Each one is short, builds on the [User Guide](../user-guide/interface.md), and links back to the reference pages for the features it uses.

## Before you start

- You can follow most tutorials in the **live viewer** at [web.geolibre.app](https://web.geolibre.app/), which is the browser build of GeoLibre. No installation required.
- A few steps need the **desktop app**: opening and saving project files, reading local MBTiles and rasters, and the Python sidecar tools (raster processing and sidecar conversions). These are called out where they appear. See [Downloads](../downloads.md) to install. The Whitebox geoprocessing toolbox is not among them — its 1,000+ tools run in the browser on WebAssembly.
- The sample dataset used in several tutorials is a public GeoParquet file of world countries: `https://data.source.coop/giswqs/opengeos/countries.parquet`.

## The tutorials

| Tutorial | You will learn to |
| --- | --- |
| [Your First Map](first-map.md) | Add a layer, style it, inspect attributes, and save. |
| [Cloud-Native Data](cloud-native-data.md) | Load remote GeoParquet, FlatGeobuf, and COG, and convert local data. |
| [Vector Analysis](vector-analysis.md) | Buffer and overlay layers, then export the result. |
| [Terrain Analysis](terrain-analysis.md) | Derive hillshade, slope, and contours from a DEM. |
| [Spatial SQL](spatial-sql.md) | Query data with DuckDB Spatial and map the results. |
| [Sharing & Embedding](sharing-embedding.md) | Share a project and embed it in a web page. |

Work through them in order for a guided tour, or jump to the one that matches your task.
