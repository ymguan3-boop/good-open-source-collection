# GeoLibre vs. other GIS platforms

How GeoLibre compares to the desktop GIS, cloud GIS, and web-mapping tools people
most often ask about: **QGIS**, **ArcGIS Pro**, **ArcGIS Online**, **CARTO**,
**Felt**, and **kepler.gl** — plus **Google Earth** and **Google Earth Pro**,
which get [a section of their own](#google-earth-and-google-earth-pro) because
they are virtual globes rather than a GIS.

GeoLibre is not trying to replace any of these outright. It occupies a spot none
of them quite fills: a **free and open-source GIS that runs in a browser tab with
nothing installed**, keeps your data on your own machine, and still ships real
analysis, spatial SQL, cartography, and a project file — then packages the *same*
app as a desktop install, an Android app, an iOS app, and a Jupyter widget.

!!! note "How to read this"
    Comparisons like this age quickly and are written by an interested party. The
    GeoLibre column reflects [what ships today](features.md); the other columns
    describe each product's mainstream, out-of-the-box behavior as of
    **August 2026**, not what is reachable with every add-on, extension, or
    third-party plugin. Where a capability arrives through a separate product
    (QField for QGIS in the field, ArcGIS Field Maps for ArcGIS), the table says
    so rather than crediting it to the base product. Found something wrong or
    out of date? Please
    [open an issue](https://github.com/opengeos/GeoLibre/issues) — corrections
    are welcome.

!!! info "This page is closed to new columns"
    The comparison matrix below covers a fixed set of platforms and is **not
    accepting additional ones**. Every extra column means more than forty cells
    that have to be researched, dated, and re-verified on each update, and the
    tables have reached the width a page can readably hold. Adding more would
    make the comparison harder to read and harder to keep honest.

    Google Earth sits in [its own section](#google-earth-and-google-earth-pro)
    with a short table of its own, because it is a viewer rather than a GIS and
    most of the matrix rows would simply read "—" for it. That is a one-off, not
    an opening.

    Corrections to the platforms already listed are still very welcome. If you
    maintain another tool and want it compared with GeoLibre, publish that
    comparison on your own site and add a link under
    [Comparisons hosted elsewhere](#comparisons-hosted-elsewhere).

## Complementary, not competing

A useful way to think about GeoLibre and QGIS is smartphone cameras versus
professional cameras. Smartphone cameras did not replace professional cameras,
and it would not have made sense to pour every advance in photography into
making professional cameras better. The two serve different people and
different moments. A professional camera offers tremendous power, flexibility,
and control. A smartphone camera prioritizes accessibility, convenience, and
the ability to capture and share something instantly.

QGIS is the professional camera: mature, powerful, feature-rich, and
extensible. GeoLibre is closer to the smartphone camera: lightweight,
reachable from a web browser, cross-platform, and designed so that people can
work with geospatial data without installing complex software or setting up
servers.

![QGIS and GeoLibre as professional and smartphone cameras](https://assets.geolibre.app/images/QGIS-GeoLibre.webp)

The geospatial community benefits from both. Separate projects can also
experiment with new architectures and technologies, and the ideas that work out
can strengthen the broader open-source geospatial ecosystem. The goal of
GeoLibre is not to replace QGIS, but to make GIS accessible in places, and to
people, where a traditional desktop GIS may not be the best fit.

The rest of this page is written in that spirit: the tables are there to help
you pick the right tool for a given job, not to declare a winner.

## Google Earth and Google Earth Pro

Google Earth is the tool most people have used before they ever open a GIS, and
it is the comparison this project is asked about most often. It belongs in a
different category than everything above: Google Earth is a **virtual globe** for
exploring, annotating, and presenting Google's imagery, while GeoLibre is a GIS
that happens to ship a globe. The two overlap at the moment of *looking* at the
Earth and diverge almost everywhere after it.

Two products share the name, and they are heading in opposite directions:

- **Google Earth** (the web app, plus the Android and iOS apps) is the one Google
  is investing in. It comes in three plans: **Standard** is free, while
  **Professional** and **Professional Advanced** are paid per seat. Standard
  covers exploring, drawing, measuring, historical imagery, Street View, and
  broadly applicable data layers such as administrative areas, postal codes, and
  household income, with projects stored in Google Drive and shared like any
  other Drive file. The paid plans add specialized layers (finer elevation
  contours, slope and aspect, inundation history, parcel zoning, traffic), larger
  design quotas and cloud import storage, and more of the Gemini-powered *Ask
  Google Earth*, which every plan includes at a limited, higher, or highest level
  of access.
- **Google Earth Pro** (desktop, version 7.3.x) is the free application GIS users
  have leaned on for historical imagery, Shapefile and GeoTIFF import, viewshed,
  elevation profiles, and HD movie export. Google has announced that **desktop
  downloads end on 25 June 2027**, and that existing installations keep working
  after that date. A workflow that depends on being able to install Earth Pro on
  new machines is worth planning around now.

*Google Earth Engine* is a third, unrelated product — a cloud platform for
planetary-scale raster analysis — and is out of scope here.

| | **GeoLibre** | **Google Earth** (web and mobile) | **Google Earth Pro** (desktop) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **License and cost** | MIT, free | Proprietary; free tier plus paid per-seat plans | Proprietary, free — downloads end 25 June 2027 |
| **What it is for** | Analysis, cartography, and data work | Exploring, annotating, and presenting imagery | The same, with a GIS-adjacent import and measurement set |
| **Runs on** | Browser, Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, Jupyter | Browser, Android, iOS | Windows, macOS, Linux |
| **Where your data lives** | Your device, processed client-side | Your Google account and Drive | Your device |
| **Data in** | Vector, raster, tiles, databases, STAC, OGC and Esri services, and cloud-native formats (COG, GeoParquet, PMTiles, Zarr) | KML/KMZ, GeoJSON, and zipped Shapefile into projects, plus experimental GLB-only 3D model import on the web; more import storage on paid plans | KML/KMZ, Shapefile, GeoTIFF and image overlays, CSV with address geocoding, GPS/GPX, MapInfo TAB |
| **Attribute data** | Attribute table, joins, field calculator, quick filters, spatial SQL | Placemark descriptions | Basic attribute display for imported files |
| **Projections** | Reprojects on import, searchable EPSG catalog, per-project ellipsoid driving measurements | WGS84 globe only | WGS84 globe only |
| **Analysis** | 1,000+ geoprocessing tools, spatial SQL, spatial statistics, routing and isochrones | Measurement, elevation profiles on the web, and layer filtering | Measure, elevation profile, viewshed |
| **Symbology** | Data-driven single, categorized, graduated, rule-based, expression, heatmap, cluster, proportional | KML styles set by hand | KML styles set by hand, plus style templates driven by a data column |
| **Historical imagery** | Historical Imagery plugin over Esri World Imagery snapshots, plus Timelapse annual basemaps | A timeline of the capture dates available for a place, plus historical Street View on the web | Historical imagery slider |
| **Photorealistic 3D and Street View** | Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles and Street View with your own API key; plus 3D Tiles, I3S, LiDAR, COPC, and Gaussian splats | Native, no key, best-in-class | 3D buildings and Street View |
| **Presentation output** | Story maps, print layout with atlas, camera tour recorded to video, dashboards, one-file offline HTML export | Shareable Drive projects with a slide-style present mode | Movie Maker HD video and high-resolution image export |
| **Project file** | `.geolibre.json` — open, documented, diffable, local | Hosted project in Drive; KML export | `.kmz` / `.kml` |
| **Automation** | Python package, MCP server, Jupyter widget, TypeScript plugin API, embed API | — | — |

### Where they overlap

GeoLibre borrows from the Google Earth playbook on purpose, and several features
exist precisely because people expect them from Earth: a **Cesium globe** with
terrain, an **Elevation Profile** along a drawn or selected line, an interactive
**viewshed** from a right-clicked point, **Historical Imagery**, **Street View**,
a **camera tour recorder** that exports video, and **planetary globes** for the
Moon, Mars, and beyond.

KML fidelity gets the same treatment. GeoLibre reads KML and KMZ with an in-house
parser that preserves embedded symbology, folder structure, `GroundOverlay`
images, time-tagged placemarks, embedded COLLADA models, and `NetworkLink`
Super-Overlays served as tiles rather than loaded whole — so a document authored
in Earth Pro generally arrives looking the way it did there. That makes GeoLibre
a realistic destination for a KML archive when Earth Pro downloads end, and the
map's right-click menu still offers **Open in Google Earth** for trips in the
other direction.

### Where Google Earth is still better

- **Imagery.** Google's own imagery archive, its depth of historical coverage,
  and the quality of its photorealistic 3D mesh are not things an open-source
  project reproduces. GeoLibre can display Google's photorealistic tiles with
  your API key, but the archive and the historical slider belong to Earth.
- **Street View.** Native, complete, and free of credential setup.
- **Effortlessness.** Earth opens and flies. There is no layer model, no CRS, no
  project file, and nothing to learn — for simply showing someone a place, that
  is exactly right.

### Where GeoLibre is better

Everything downstream of looking: attribute tables and joins, a real
geoprocessing toolbox, spatial SQL, data-driven cartography, print layouts,
reprojection, and an open project file you can keep, diff, script, and embed.
Earth shows you the world; GeoLibre lets you ask questions of your own data on
top of it — and keeps that data on your machine rather than in a Google account.

## Where each one is the right choice

**Choose GeoLibre when** you want a real GIS in a browser tab with nothing to
install, your data has to stay on your machine, you work with cloud-native
formats (COG, GeoParquet, PMTiles, Zarr, STAC), you want the same app on desktop,
Android, and inside a notebook, or you are embedding a map workspace into your
own product and want an open, documented project format and license.

**Choose QGIS when** you need the widest possible format support through
GDAL/OGR, the deepest desktop cartography and label placement, a mature plugin
for a niche task, or heavy local processing over datasets larger than a browser
can hold.

**Choose ArcGIS Pro when** you are already in the Esri ecosystem, need
enterprise geodatabase editing and versioning, the deepest 3D and imagery
workflows, or a specific specialized toolbox with organizational support behind
it.

**Choose ArcGIS Online when** the priority is hosted layers, organizational
sharing and permissions, and the surrounding Esri app family (Dashboards,
StoryMaps, Field Maps, Experience Builder).

**Choose CARTO when** your data already lives in a cloud data warehouse and you
need it to stay there. It suits teams that want AI Agents, visual analytics
pipelines, dashboards and/or custom apps for large-scale data that non-analysts
can use.

**Choose Felt when** collaborative, low-friction map *making* with a team is the
whole job, and polished multiplayer editing and field data collection matter more
than analysis depth. Enterprise plans can run a single-tenant instance in your own
AWS account if data residency is the blocker.

**Choose kepler.gl when** you want fast, beautiful exploratory visualization of
large point and trip datasets, and DuckDB SQL plus its AI assistant cover the
analysis you need — rather than a geoprocessing toolbox, cartographic output, or
a portable project file.

**Choose Google Earth when** the job is to look at the world, show it to someone,
or annotate a place — Google's imagery, historical coverage, Street View, and
photorealistic 3D are unmatched, and nothing has to be learned first. **Choose
GeoLibre over Google Earth Pro when** you need attribute data, analysis,
projections, or cartographic output, or when you want a successor now that Earth
Pro downloads end on 25 June 2027; GeoLibre reads KML and KMZ with their
symbology, overlays, models, and Super-Overlays intact.

They also compose. GeoLibre reads QGIS and ArcGIS Pro projects and exchanges
symbology as SLD, QML, and Mapbox GL JSON, so it is reasonable to author in
QGIS or Pro and publish or embed with GeoLibre.

## Where GeoLibre is not the strongest option

Stated plainly, so the table above is worth trusting:

- **Very large local datasets.** Browser memory and WASM are real limits.
  Client-side vector tiling and streaming push the ceiling up, but a
  multi-gigabyte local processing job still belongs on a desktop GIS. The
  desktop build's Python sidecar helps; QGIS or ArcGIS Pro helps more.
- **Format breadth.** GDAL/OGR reads more than DuckDB-WASM Spatial does. Some
  formats — notably File Geodatabase — only work in the desktop build.
- **Depth of specialized toolboxes.** ArcGIS Pro's Spatial Analyst, Geostatistical
  Analyst, and Network Analyst, and QGIS's twenty years of plugins, cover
  workflows GeoLibre has no equivalent for.
- **Enterprise data management.** Versioned editing, replication, and enterprise
  geodatabase administration are outside GeoLibre's scope.
- **Maturity.** GeoLibre is stable and in active development, but it is far
  younger than QGIS or ArcGIS. Some capabilities listed as shipping are recent —
  see [Recently added](index.md#recently-added).
