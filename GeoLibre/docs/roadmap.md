- [x] Raster Georeferencer (Processing → Georeferencing): pin a non-georeferenced image to the map with ground control points, using a least-squares affine fit and per-GCP and RMS residuals, added as a corner-pinned overlay that persists in the project and works offline
- [x] Field Collection tool (Controls menu) for capturing point, line, and polygon observations with a per-layer custom form (text/number/date/choice fields and an optional inline photo), placed by device GPS or by tapping the map, with a floating quick-open control; captures are written to a tagged GeoJSON layer that flows into the attribute table, export, and offline use
- [x] Runtime overrides for `VITE_PYODIDE_INDEX_URL` and `VITE_DUCKDB_SPATIAL_EXTENSION_PATH` through the existing runtime-environment system, so air-gapped or corporate deployments can point Pyodide and the DuckDB Spatial extension at internal mirrors without rebuilding the app

## v1.5: Dashboards, in-browser Whitebox, map navigation history, and signed macOS installers

- [x] Dashboard panel of chart widgets that summarizes the loaded layers at a glance, with configurable charts and a collapsible layout that docks alongside the map

- [x] Print layout composer gained an explicit map-scale input, a title block with editable title and footer, page-size controls, and a custom print extent, with more reliable preview rendering for production-quality PNG and PDF map exports
- [x] Time Slider can bind existing vector layers already on the map to the timeline, animating their time-series attributes without re-importing the data
- [x] New View menu with viewport history navigation (step back and forward through previous map extents), a reset pitch and bearing control with a rotation indicator, a distinct north arrow in place of the ambiguous compass, a lock indicator when map bounds are restricted, and a refined default set of top-right map controls
- [x] Saved service library for web-service layers, so frequently used WMS, WFS, XYZ, and ArcGIS endpoints can be stored once and re-added with a click rather than re-entered each session
- [x] Add Data dialog is now fully internationalized and accepts comma decimal separators and drag-and-dropped CSV files for coordinate data
- [x] Inspect COG pixel values directly from the Identify icon, plus reversed and custom raster color ramps, the full colormap list, and a styling panel you can reopen from the layer actions menu
- [x] Customizable UI profiles that tailor which menus, panels, and data sources are visible, so a deployment can present a focused subset of the app to its users (see [UI Profiles](ui-profiles.md))
- [x] Bookmarks now capture the active layers alongside the camera, with selectable export, a resizable and reorderable panel, and a save-as name prompt
- [x] Sequential route (directions) network tool under Processing for computing routes through an ordered set of waypoints
- [x] Protomaps basemaps in the New map dialog, support for stacking multiple raster basemaps, and basemap element visibility presets in the layer control
- [x] Spinning Globe panel under Atmospheric Effects and customizable atmosphere halo and deep-space colors for the globe view
- [x] Notebook panel can split the workspace 50/50 with the map and auto-collapse the Style panel for more room, and the attribute table gains a column explorer for finding and toggling fields in wide tables
- [x] USGS LiDAR plugin replaces the previous LiDAR Viewer for browsing and loading USGS 3DEP point-cloud data, imported KML and KMZ layers honor their embedded symbology, and vector strokes can be sized in scale-proportional meters
- [x] macOS desktop installers are now signed with an Apple Developer ID certificate and notarized by Apple, so they open without a Gatekeeper workaround, with a generator for submitting GeoLibre to the official Homebrew cask (see [Downloads](downloads.md))

## v1.6: Multi-map layouts, advanced symbology and labeling, and plugin zip install

- [x] Multi-map grid that splits the workspace into a grid of map views with synchronized camera movement, so you can compare basemaps, layers, or time steps side by side

## v1.7: Plugin UI host API, color ramp previews, and category-browsed Whitebox tools

- [x] Plugin UI host API that lets plugins register first-class right-sidebar panels, toolbar menus, and floating panels that dock beside the built-in Style panel instead of emulating an overlay, with external plugin toolbar menus now placed after the Help menu (see [Plugin API](plugin-api.md))
- [x] Color ramp gradient swatches in both the vector Style panel and the raster Color ramp picker, so you can see each colormap's gradient inline (on the trigger and beside every option) while choosing rather than picking from a plain list of names
- [x] Richer vector labeling with ArcGIS-style controls (anchor, X/Y offset, rotation, wrap width, and letter case), a Duplicate labels option, and unique/concatenate modes that collapse points stacked at the same coordinate into a single deduplicated label
- [x] Whitebox toolbox is now browsable by category directly in the Processing menu, with nested subcategory submenus, GeoLibre's own WASM tools grouped under their own subheading, an offline-bundled tool catalog for restricted environments, and tools that open the dialog preselected and scrolled into view
- [x] On-canvas collaboration session-status badge and roster (a pulsing live dot, connected-participant count, and an expandable client list that announces joins and leaves), plus a clear "Go to map and collaborate" button so the host has a non-destructive way back to the map
- [x] Welcome wizard is suppressed for embeds: project deep links (`?url=`) skip onboarding automatically, and a new `?welcome=0` parameter lets any embed opt out

## v1.8: Camera tours, live story maps, standalone HTML export, and map annotations

- [x] **Virtual fields**: expression-backed computed columns that update as the underlying data changes, plus a Raster Attribute Table for single-band categorical rasters
- [x] An **attribute form designer** with edit widgets, validation constraints, and conditional field visibility for structured data entry
- [x] **Persistent attribute joins** configured in layer properties, so a table can enrich a layer's features and stick across sessions
- [x] **Select by Expression** and **Select by Location**, plus live query layers backed by DuckDB SQL that re-run as the data updates
- [x] **Atlas / map series** in the Print Layout — generate one page per feature, or a uniform series of pages along a line such as a river or trail — and drop attribute-table and chart blocks onto the page
- [x] Browser-native format conversion for COG, FlatGeobuf, Shapefile, and GeoPackage, and Vector to PMTiles running on a background worker, no Python sidecar required
- [x] **Live GPS tracking**: a moving position marker, a recorded track log, and digitizing new features straight from the GPS feed
- [x] Data quality tools to check validity, fix geometries, and check topology rules, catching and repairing bad geometries before they cause trouble
- [x] A **Processing History** panel that lists every tool run, re-runs it with one click, and copies the equivalent Python code
- [x] Timelapse mode now animates EOX Sentinel-2 cloudless annual basemaps and NASA GIBS providers (Landsat/WELD and MODIS land cover) with a provider picker and legend
- [x] Desktop gains OS trust store and mTLS client-certificate support for native HTTP, automatic reload when local files change on disk, and Esri File Geodatabase (`.gdb`) layer support
- [x] New Natural Earth and Source Cooperative data browsers under Plugins > Web Services, including opening or streaming large GeoParquet from Source Cooperative
- [x] Terrain-aware 3D measurements in the Measure tool, optional title/source captions and on-map panel capture (HTML, legend, colorbar) in video recordings, and a new Georgian locale alongside full Arabic right-to-left support

## v2.3: An on-map Legend panel, iOS and Google Play, the GeoLens catalog, and space-time hot spots

- [x] An auto-generated **Legend panel** on the map that derives itself from the visible layers' symbology — per-class rows for graduated, categorized, rule-based, and expression styling, gradient bars for heatmaps and continuous raster colormaps, proportional-symbol size ramps, diagram fields, and land-cover labels read from a Raster Attribute Table — with an edit mode for renaming, hiding, and reordering entries, adding a section from a color dictionary, choosing a corner, collapsing sections, resizing the panel, and exporting the rendered legend as JSON, all saved with the project and shared with the Print Layout legend
- [x] **Symbology swatches in the Layers panel**: every row carries a dot, line, square, or image glyph colored from the layer's own styling, dimmed when the layer is hidden, so a tall layer stack reads at a glance
- [x] A new **GeoLens catalog browser** plugin for connecting to a self-hosted [GeoLens](https://github.com/geolens-io/geolens) server, searching its catalog, and adding datasets as signed vector tiles, OGC API Features GeoJSON, or server-rendered raster tiles, with automatic tile-token refresh and a Metadata link back to each dataset's page
- [x] **iOS support**, scaffolded end to end — Tauri iOS configuration, location permissions, a signing and TestFlight CI workflow, and a publishing guide. See [iOS](ios.md)
- [x] The **Android build is Google Play-ready**: a permanent `org.geolibre.app` package id, API level 36, 16 KB page-size alignment verified in CI, and a signed universal App Bundle published alongside the per-architecture sideload APKs. See [Android](android.md)
- [x] **Emerging Hot Spot Analysis**: aggregate timestamped points into a space-time cube, run Getis-Ord Gi\* per time slice, and classify every cell as a new, intensifying, persistent, diminishing, sporadic, oscillating, or historical hot or cold spot, entirely in the browser
- [x] The Time Slider animates **mosaic sources** — a MosaicJSON or STAC collection of many COGs per date — rendered as a full spatial mosaic through either the GPU or the WASM engine, with the WASM engine working in globe as well as mercator projection
- [x] **Copy and paste layer styles** between layers from the layer menu, so a set of vectors or rasters can be given one consistent look without restyling each in turn
- [x] **Multiple named AI profiles**: define several provider, model, and credential combinations, mark one as the default, and switch between them from the assistant panel
- [x] **Deep-link any Whitebox tool** with a `?tool=` URL parameter that opens the Processing dialog preselected and pre-fills the tool's form from the remaining query parameters, plus a Copy link button that builds a shareable link from the settings you changed
- [x] Add Data gains a source **CRS field for delimited text**, so CSVs with projected easting and northing columns land in the right place, and a **layer picker for multi-layer GeoPackages**, so a container full of feature tables adds only what you asked for
- [x] The layer metadata dialog reports a raster's real georeferencing read from the GeoTIFF header — CRS and EPSG code, pixel size and extent in CRS units, data type, nodata, compression, tiling, and overviews — in a resizable dialog
- [x] Type a coordinate into the place-search box to fly straight to it, in decimal degrees, DMS, or DDM, with no geocoder round-trip
- [x] A new Random extract vector tool, the active layer now persists with the project, turning on the Terrain control enables 3D relief immediately, and a Logos submenu adds Maptoolkit branding alongside the MapLibre logo

## v2.4: STAC and Earthdata catalogs, a free-flight camera, a timeline for tiles and data cubes, and a live embed API

- [x] A new **STAC catalogs browser** plugin that discovers public SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs from STAC Index, connects to both static catalogs and STAC APIs, searches a collection's items, and adds any visualizable asset — COGs, GeoJSON, and the rest — straight to the map, so working with STAC no longer means leaving the app to hand-copy asset URLs
- [x] A new **Earthdata GIS browser** under Plugins > Web Services that searches NASA's EOSDIS ArcGIS portal and renders its imagery, map, and feature services, and its published web maps, as first-class layers, with the mosaic pixel-size limits that used to return blank tiles handled for you
- [x] A new **Hugging Face** panel that browses the Hub: search datasets or name an account, walk a repo's folders, and add its vector and raster files to the map through the readers that already handle each format — and go the other way, creating a dataset repo and uploading layers to it from inside GeoLibre
- [x] A **flight simulator**: a continuous, interactive free-flight camera you steer over terrain and 3D layers with the keyboard, instead of declaring a destination and watching a scripted `flyTo`
- [x] The **Time Slider now animates tiled data**: vector tiles, PMTiles, and MBTiles can be bound to the timeline and animated over their full extent, with the timestamp field detected from a live tile sample rather than requiring a local copy of the data
- [x] The Time Slider also drives a layer's **own internal time dimension** through a generic temporal adapter, so a data cube such as a Zarr store joins the shared timeline instead of carrying its own bespoke time control, and the binding is saved with the project
- [x] **Zarr gets a real Add Data path**: an Add Zarr Layer dialog for remote stores or a folder on disk, variable and dimension pickers that offer the store's actual coordinate values rather than raw indices, and a Selector field that now applies to a layer already on the map
- [x] **OGC API - Features** collections can be added as vector layers, the JSON-native successor to WFS, from whatever URL you have in hand — a landing page, `/collections`, or a full items URL
- [x] A versioned **`postMessage` API for host pages** that frame GeoLibre: load a project, move the camera, highlight features, and open a processing tool at runtime, with `ready`, `projectLoaded`, `selectionChanged`, `viewChanged`, `toolCompleted`, and `serverFileWritten` events coming back out. Off unless the deployment names its trusted origins. See [Embedding & Sharing](user-guide/embedding.md#talking-to-the-map-at-runtime)
- [x] **Jupyter clients outside the app can drive the map**: attaching VS Code's Jupyter extension, `jupyter console`, or nbclient to the desktop app's Jupyter server now makes `fly_to`, `add_geojson`, and the rest work, because the transport follows the kernel's server rather than how the notebook happens to be displayed
- [x] A new **H3 hexagonal grid plugin** that renders the H3 grid over the current view at a chosen resolution, identifies a cell to inspect its index, parent, children, neighbors, and center, and exports the grid or the selection as GeoJSON or CSV — plus typing an **H3 cell index** into the place-search box, as a hexadecimal string or a 64-bit integer, to frame and outline that cell
- [x] **Object detection on geotagged photos**: run the in-browser ONNX/YOLO models over an imported photo layer, not just map imagery
- [x] The AI assistant gains a **model picker in the panel itself**, refreshed model lists for every provider, credentials that survive a provider change, and arrow-key recall of previous prompts
- [x] **Indicator (KPI) tiles in the Dashboard panel**: a big-number widget with count, sum, mean, min, max, or median aggregation and custom prefix and suffix, alongside the existing chart widgets
- [x] **Editing GeoLens datasets in place**: a dataset added as GeoJSON can be redrawn with the GeoEditor or retyped in the attribute table, and the plugin's Edits section shows what changed and writes it back to the GeoLens dataset — added, moved, and deleted features become per-feature `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` calls, with the row ids GeoLens assigns stamped back onto the layer. Private GeoLens rasters also render now, with the API key attached to exactly their tile URLs and nothing else
- [x] Plugins can call `addZarrLayer` to use the Zarr renderer GeoLibre already ships instead of bundling their own, keep their own paint properties on custom layers so the Style panel's sliders actually do something, and expose layer groups of their own
- [x] GeoLibre is on **[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.geolibre.app)**, so Android users can install the signed, auto-updating build in one tap instead of sideloading an APK (see [Downloads](downloads.md#android-installation))
- [x] GeoLibre Desktop is on the **[Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/geolibre-desktop/id6796848769)**, a sandboxed build of the same app that installs and updates through the Store. It trades the Python sidecar engines, server-backed PostgreSQL/PostGIS layers via martin, the local Jupyter server, Earth Engine sign-in, and external plugin installs for that convenience, so the Homebrew and DMG builds remain the full-feature route (see [Downloads](downloads.md#mac-app-store))
- [x] Linux **AppImage releases now carry update information and a `.zsync`**, so AppImageUpdate, AppImageLauncher, AppManager, and AM can update the app and transfer only the blocks that changed instead of the whole download
- [x] All 15 non-English locales are back at 100% coverage, Georgian included

## v2.5: QGIS and ArcGIS Pro project import, discrete global grids, hyperspectral cubes, and a self-hostable server

- [x] **QGIS project import**: open a `.qgs` or `.qgz` and get its layers, nested groups, group visibility, layer order, styling, and saved map view rebuilt in GeoLibre, with a per-layer report of anything that had to be skipped rather than an all-or-nothing failure. See [Projects](user-guide/projects.md#importing-a-qgis-project)
- [x] **ArcGIS Pro project import**: `.aprx` and `.mapx` files are read straight from their CIM JSON without ArcPy, restoring the first 2D map's extent, local vector and GeoTIFF layers, nested groups, visibility, simple symbols, field labels, vector-tile portal items, and cached map services. See [Projects](user-guide/projects.md#importing-an-arcgis-pro-project)
- [x] **Discrete global grid systems** arrive as three new plugins under Plugins > DGGS — **A5**, **DGGRID**, and **DGGAL** — that render the grid over the current view at a chosen or automatic resolution, identify a cell to read its id, parents, children, neighbors, and center, and add the grid or the selection to the map as a layer or export it
- [x] **DGGS processing tools** to match: a DGGS Generator that fills an extent with cells, DGGS Binning that aggregates a point layer into them, and DGGS Compact that collapses a full set of children into their parent
- [x] **Hyperspectral NetCDF and HDF grids become readable data rather than a single grey band**: local grids are colormapped in the browser from the same catalog the Style panel uses, the camera fits to the layer on add, and a cube gains an RGB band combination picked by wavelength
- [x] **A 3D image cube view** renders a hyperspectral scene as its six exterior faces with draggable slice cuts, so a volume can be read as a volume — windowed and strided reads keep a full EMIT reflectance variable within what the browser can hold
- [x] **Spectral profiles from a click**: identify a pixel on a NetCDF layer to read its value, walk the band axis to chart its spectrum against wavelength, and compare up to six sampled points, each marked on the map as a numbered dot in its chart color, in a floating draggable window that exports as PNG or CSV
- [x] **Sharing, accounts, and live collaboration can now be self-hosted**: the projects and identity contract is written down, with a FastAPI reference implementation and a plain Node collaboration relay sharing one session core, and a single conformance suite runs against both relays so their permission behavior cannot drift. See [Server API](server-api.md)
- [x] A published web image can be **pointed at that server at runtime** through `GEOLIBRE_SHARE_URL` and `GEOLIBRE_COLLAB_URL`, instead of forking the image to rebuild it, with `off` removing Share and the Project Gallery entirely and a malformed value refusing to boot rather than quietly uploading projects to the public hosted service
- [x] **Smart styling on add**: each new vector layer takes the next unused color from a qualitative palette with sizing that follows its dominant geometry, so a freshly loaded stack is legible before the Style panel is ever opened, and a dismissible **Style suggestions** strip offers up to three one-click renderers derived from the layer's own attributes
- [x] **Vector-tile layers can be classified by their tile attributes**: PMTiles, MBTiles, and remote vector tiles carry no local features, so the Style panel now samples what the viewport has already loaded to fill in the field list and the classifier's values, and 3D extrusion defaults to a real height property
- [x] **Quick analysis** from the map's right-click menu and a layer's actions menu: buffer the clicked point at three distances or drive and walk isochrones from it, and buffer, centroid, convex hull, or bounding-box a whole layer, with defaults filled in and every run landing in Processing History, re-runnable and copyable as Python
- [x] An **Elements panel** that lists the map's annotations — text, arrows, rectangle, ellipse and freehand highlights, pin markers, sticky notes, and placed images — so each one is managed from a list instead of hunted for on the canvas, with a placed image optionally pinned to an extent so it scales with the view. See [Annotations and the Elements panel](user-guide/map-controls.md#annotations-and-the-elements-panel)
- [x] A **Layer Library**: save a fully configured layer, with its source, style, labels, filters, joins, virtual fields, and attribute form, then re-add it to any later project in one click from the Browser panel's My Data section, and export the library as a JSON bundle to share with a team
- [x] **Project duplication, templates, and open-a-copy**: duplicate a project, save one as a reusable template that keeps the basemap, groups, styles, legend, widgets, and layout while stripping the data, and open a copy of anything in the gallery
- [x] **Live layer connections persist with the project**: the refresh cadence, last-synchronized time, last error, and on-failure policy for WFS, GeoJSON URL, and Add Vector Layer URL layers are saved as a `connection` record, so a reopened project keeps refreshing on schedule and the Layers panel shows each live layer's status
- [x] **Open-data catalog browsers** for **ArcGIS Hub**, **Socrata**, and **CKAN** (Humanitarian Data Exchange) under Plugins > Web Services: search public dataset catalogs by keyword, restrict an ArcGIS Hub search to the current map area, page through results, and add a dataset to the map or download it
- [x] **Geocode a CSV at import time**: the Delimited Text panel gains an Addresses mode that concatenates the columns you pick and geocodes each row through the project's provider, keeping unmatched rows as null-geometry features so they stay visible and fixable in the attribute table rather than being silently dropped
- [x] A **CartoCiudad (IGN España) geocoding provider** for forward and reverse geocoding against Spain's official address data, with no API key
- [x] **KML and KMZ layer export**, so a styled layer can go back out to Google Earth, and **KML Super-Overlay import**, which serves a `NetworkLink`-driven tile pyramid to the map instead of loading the whole thing at once
- [x] A **Dashboard selector widget** that turns a categorical field into a set of chips and cross-filters every other widget bound to the same layer, in single- or multi-select mode
- [x] **GPS Tracking reads an external NMEA receiver** over Web Serial or Web Bluetooth, with a baud-rate picker and a live sentence and fix counter, alongside the device's own geolocation. See [GPS tracking](user-guide/map-controls.md#gps-tracking)
- [x] The Processing dialog stops asking users to translate on their behalf: distance parameters on WGS84 vector layers get a **metric unit picker** that converts to the degrees the tool actually reads, EPSG parameters get a **searchable CRS catalog** grouped into Geographic and Projected, and Download OSM Vector's four boundary numbers become one **Area of interest** control with Use map extent and Draw on map
- [x] **GeoLibre Desktop is on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/geolibre-desktop/id6796848769)**, a sandboxed build of the same app that installs and updates through the Store. See [Downloads](downloads.md#mac-app-store)
- [x] **GeoLibre is on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/geolibre/id6796039674)** as a native iPhone and iPad app, built from the same codebase via Tauri v2 mobile and approved by App Store review, so iOS users install and update it in one tap. See [iOS](ios.md)
- [x] The `geolibre` Python package gains **leafmap-parity helpers**: local raster, marker and cluster, and choropleth layers, `split_map`, `add_legend`, and `add_colorbar`, typed read-back of selected and drawn features, and `to_html` export. See [Python package](python.md)
- [x] **Thai** joins the shipped locales, bringing the catalogs to 16 languages besides English
- [x] Vector export honors the fields you hid in the attribute table, plugins can read a pixel off a native Zarr layer with `queryZarrLayer`, layers move into a group as a whole selection, and the print extent can be drawn by touch

## v2.6: Data and style deep links, an MCP server for AI clients, COG-backed terrain, and a design system of its own

- [x] **Deep links can carry the data itself**: `?data=` opens a hosted GeoJSON, GeoParquet, COG, PMTiles, a REST endpoint returning a FeatureCollection, or a ZIP of GeoJSON files without publishing a project file first, `?style=` applies vector or raster symbology beside it, and a compact GeoLibre style export makes that style file easy to produce from a layer already on the map. See [Embedding & Sharing](user-guide/embedding.md)
- [x] **ArcGIS MapServer and ImageServer join Add Data**: the two service types that serve rendered images load as ordinary raster layers, so opacity, the Style panel's brightness, contrast and saturation controls, reordering, and project save and reload all work on them, drawing tiles from the service's own fused cache where it was built on the standard Web Mercator scheme and from `/export` or `/exportImage` otherwise. Sublayers are browsed and picked from the service's own list rather than typed in as ids, and an ImageServer rendering rule is one field away
- [x] **A Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF can drive 3D terrain**: terrain was locked to the global AWS Terrarium tiles, so higher-resolution local elevation could not shape the hillshade. Terrain settings now accept a single-band EPSG:3857 or EPSG:4326 COG over HTTP or from a local file, read in ranges and encoded to Terrarium tiles through a custom MapLibre protocol
- [x] **Regional basemaps, starting with China**: GeoLibre's defaults are hosted outside mainland China with no presence inside it, so from there the picker offered nothing that loads. A collapsed **Regional** section in both the New Project and Change Basemap panels adds five keyless Chinese basemaps (高德地图, 高德卫星, 高德混合, 腾讯地图, 腾讯深色), with the same providers plus Tianditu in the Basemaps control plugin, and the section is driven by a table in core so a second region is an entry rather than another dialog change
- [x] **The basemap you picked is the one you come back to**: an empty startup workspace seeds from your last selected basemap, while a project's own basemap stays authoritative and planetary bodies keep their ellipsoid behavior
- [x] **Collaboration snapshots are portable**: a guest could join a session and see an empty map, because snapshots kept local file references and control-managed vector data the collaborator cannot read. Shared layers now embed their features, a host seeds the first snapshot instead of waiting to make an edit, guests arrive at the host's viewport, and the session Copy button yields a joinable URL. See [Collaboration](collaboration.md)
- [x] **Map comments become navigable**: clicking a pin on the map reveals, highlights, and scrolls to its card, the panel ships collapsed on the Style rail so it is discoverable, `C` places a new comment from the command palette, and comments are saved with the project. See [Review comments](user-guide/map-controls.md#review-comments)
- [x] **An MCP server for authoring projects**, `geolibre-mcp`: a headless stdio server that lets an AI client write real `.geolibre.json` files with no browser and no running app, composing them from the same builders the Python package already uses, so anything it writes opens unchanged in the desktop app, the web app, and the Jupyter widget. Every read and write is confined to the roots given by `--root` or `GEOLIBRE_MCP_ROOTS`. See [MCP server](mcp.md)
- [x] **The Python package manages layers and moves the camera without a browser round trip**: reorder, duplicate, rename, and remove layers, read attribute values, and frame the map as plain project mutations on `Map` and `Layer`, with the authoring helpers exported for scripts that never display a widget, and credentials swept out of anything a notebook cell might print back. See [Python package](python.md)
- [x] **Whitebox tools run from the Jupyter widget**: `list_whitebox_tools` and `run_whitebox_tool` reach the bundled WASM catalog over the same channel the camera and the client-side algorithms already use, resolving `Layer` handles to layer ids and adding both vector and raster outputs back to the map, so terrain and raster work no longer means leaving the notebook for the UI
- [x] **Topological polygon digitizing**, so a polygon drawn against its neighbor shares that edge instead of leaving a sliver or an overlap behind
- [x] **Print Layout gains an intersecting page filter**, so an attribute-table block can list every feature the page touches rather than only the ones that fall wholly inside it, correct across the antimeridian and for a view panned several world copies from home
- [x] **Story map PDF handouts get clickable location markers**: each chapter page carries a pin drawn with its tip on the chapter camera's centre coordinate and a PDF link that opens that coordinate in Google Maps, taking the story's marker color, so a reader of the printed handout can navigate to the place
- [x] **A design system of the app's own, in place of stock shadcn**: self-hosted IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Mono so the interface reads the same everywhere instead of Segoe UI on Windows, Roboto on Linux, and SF on macOS; a real dark-mode elevation ladder where panels, dialogs, and menus had all shared one near-identical color; theme-aware shadows that were effectively invisible in dark mode; and a single map-glass treatment for chrome floating over the map, replacing eleven drifted copies of it
- [x] **Embeds can lead with the map**: a `panels=collapsed` layout keeps the Layers and Style icon rails reachable while starting both panels collapsed, and the top toolbar can be hidden outright for a focused viewer, giving a middle ground between panels open and panels gone. See [Embedding & Sharing](user-guide/embedding.md)
- [x] **An optional Clerk access gate** for hosted deployments that need individual sign-in, with an optional waitlist screen, loaded on demand and kept out of the default PWA precache. The gate is decided by the build target rather than by a client-controlled query parameter, and public, native, and embedded builds are unchanged. See [Getting started](getting-started.md)
- [x] **A no-external-CDN build** for deployments that cannot load from untrusted third-party hosts: `GEOLIBRE_NO_EXTERNAL_CDN=1` strips the GeoLibre-controlled CDN references, vendors the PGlite and CereusDB engines into the build rather than dropping them, and makes the few features that genuinely need a remote host say so up front instead of failing at the end of a run. See [Self-hosting](self-hosting.md)
- [x] **External plugins can query layers read-only**, reading the features a layer holds through the host rather than re-fetching and re-parsing the source themselves. See [Plugin API](plugin-api.md)
- [x] **Persian and Vietnamese join the shipped locales**, bringing the catalogs to 18 languages besides English, with Persian set in Vazirmatn and only that font's arabic subset shipped, so no other locale pays for it
- [x] Selecting a layer no longer pops the Style panel open over the map; it expands from an explicit **Open Style panel** item in the layer's menu instead

## v2.7: A visual Model Builder, STAC assets of every kind, a Chrome data opener, and selection by drawing

- [x] **Processing workflows are drawn on a canvas**, ArcGIS Model Builder style: drop tools as nodes, wire an output into the next tool's input, and save the graph as a model that re-runs as one job, with the whole graph validated (cycles, missing connections, invented parameters, a string where a number belongs) before anything executes
- [x] **The AI assistant can author a model from a plain-English description** and open it on the canvas for review before it runs, drawing on the same palette as the canvas itself, so a raster chain such as fill depressions to flow accumulation to extract streams is a valid model. It asks before replacing unsaved canvas work or a run still in flight. See [AI assistant](user-guide/ai-assistant.md)
- [x] **A model copies out as a runnable Python script**, so a workflow built by pointing and clicking continues in the Notebook panel or JupyterLite rather than stopping at the canvas
- [x] **The STAC browser adds every asset type the app can draw**: PMTiles archives, GeoParquet tables, and Zarr stores with a variable picker join the COGs it already loaded, an Icechunk repository is read through its own manifest and keyed by branch rather than by repository alone, and Azure-hosted assets are signed at add time so a private Planetary Computer container opens like a public one
- [x] **A static STAC catalog can be browsed as a tree**, not only searched: walk its collections and sub-collections, open a folder to read it, and start a search from whatever you picked, flying to that collection's own extent
- [x] **Select features by drawing on the map**: QGIS-style click, rectangle, polygon, freehand, and radius gestures, with Shift and Alt combining the result into the existing selection and Clear selection sitting alongside them, so picking a handful of features means pointing at them instead of describing them in an expression
- [x] **Open data in GeoLibre**, a [Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/open-data-in-geolibre/joinecgbfoldanidcoakpjgkbaceaooj) on the Chrome Web Store, collects the dataset links and map services on the page you are viewing (WMS, WMTS, WFS, OGC API - Features, ArcGIS Feature Services, XYZ/TMS, and vector tiles, including services detected inside embedded maps and raw responses) and opens the ones you pick together on one GeoLibre map
- [x] **Apache Iceberg tables load as vector layers**, read in-browser through DuckDB's `iceberg` and `spatial` extensions from a table's metadata location or an attached REST catalog, reporting the table's true row count from the manifest before anything is scanned, taking the geometry column's CRS from the schema, and letting an optional SQL box decide which rows are rendered
- [x] **Three vector tools the client-side suite was missing**: Merge layers, with a multi-layer parameter picker that unites attribute schemas and can record each feature's source layer; Extract vertices, which turns every vertex into a point carrying its part and vertex index; and Points along geometry, which walks lines and polygon boundaries geodesically at a fixed interval
- [x] **Encoded polylines become a first-class format**: a codec for Google and OSRM precision 5 and Valhalla and Mapbox precision 6, with an interactive preview and coordinate inspector in Add Data, batch parsing with custom delimiters, processing tools, layer export at either precision, and matching support in the Python package
- [x] **An activity log for shared projects and collaboration sessions**: a project owner can read who opened and edited a shared project, and a session host can download the session log, bounded in both entry count and stored bytes and read through a bearer token rather than a URL query. See [Server API](server-api.md)
- [x] **Automatic editor tracking on a vector layer**: created-by, created-at, edited-by, and edited-at fields fill themselves in as features are added and changed, configured per layer and saved with the project. See [Project format](project-format.md)
- [x] **Building massing authoring**: sketch a footprint, give it a height, and get an extruded mass, with the extrusion style managed for you as massing features come and go and ordinary polygon sketches left flat
- [x] **The Elevation Profile plugin profiles the line features you have selected**, so a route already on the map is charted without redrawing it by hand
- [x] **Plugins and processing tools are translatable**: plugin display names resolve through one place, so a plugin no longer reads translated in the Plugins menu and English in the command palette, and every registry tool name, description, group label, parameter, and select option is generated into the English catalog for translators to work from. See [Internationalization](i18n.md)
- [x] **A PostGIS table with more than one geometry column stops being a guess**: every registered geometry column is offered in Add Data, validated against the PostGIS catalogs, and carried through read, save, and refresh
- [x] **A shared link can carry presentation settings**: `settingsUrl=` loads language, layout, accent theme, and UI profile before the first render, restricted to presentation fields so a link cannot inject credentials, plugins, or local paths, and lasting for that page only instead of replacing what the user has saved. See [Embedding & Sharing](user-guide/embedding.md)
- [x] **Geometry generators become attribute-driven**: derived centroids scale with a field as proportional symbols, and each feature's buffer takes its distance from a column instead of one typed number, following QGIS's data-defined overrides
- [x] **Excel workbooks import as point layers** from their X and Y columns, with a worksheet picker
- [x] **The Layers panel search box searches the map's own data**: the typed query is matched against the attributes of the loaded vector layers alongside the geocoder, running locally so data matches appear before the network answers, grouped by layer above the place results and ranked exact match first, then prefix, then contains, with picking a feature selecting it on its layer and flying to it with the attribute table's highlight
- [x] **A composite score builder for suitability and index analysis**: normalize two or more numeric fields (min-max, z-score, rank, or quantile), weight them, combine them with a weighted arithmetic or geometric mean, and write one index (0-100 by default, 0-1 on request) that the layer is immediately styled by, with how a feature missing a value is treated made an explicit choice rather than a silent default
- [x] A Style panel button on every layer card, field statistics scoped to the selected features, USGS LiDAR clipped and downloaded as COPC, ArcGIS ImageServer raster functions browsed from the service's own list, and `?data=` accepting several URLs at once

## v2.8: A popup designer, quick filters, per-layer permissions, and the packages on npm

- [x] **An author decides what a viewer sees on click and hover**: a per-layer Popup section in the Style panel picks which fields the Identify popup shows, in what order, under what labels, with what number, date, link, and image formatting, what titles it, and whether a hover tooltip follows the pointer — so a shared map, a `layout=viewer` embed, or a story-map chapter stops showing join artifacts, editor-tracking columns, and internal ids to its readers. See [Project format](project-format.md)
- [x] **Quick filters answer a layer with controls instead of an expression**: pick a field and GeoLibre profiles its values to offer the matching control — checkboxes with per-value counts for a categorical field, a range slider with typed bounds for a numeric one, a date range for a timestamp, a text match otherwise — with the control state saved, not the compiled expression, so a filter can always be reopened and changed. A filtered layer is flagged with a funnel icon and cleared in one action, the controls render in the read-only viewer layout, and a host page's `setFilter`, the Time Slider's window, and a user's own filter now narrow a layer together rather than clobbering each other
- [x] **Per-layer capabilities**: a layer can be marked read-only or restricted to creating, updating, or deleting features, and both the UI and the backend enforce it, so a reference layer in a shared project cannot be edited by the people it was shared with
- [x] **Per-layer cartographic blend modes**: overlaying color or imagery on a hillshade takes Multiply rather than reduced opacity, which dilutes both layers instead of combining them. MapLibre exposes no per-layer blend API, so the render loop is wrapped to set the GPU blend state while one layer draws, blending in the right z-position of the same canvas, with fills and lines composited as one surface and labels left out so place names stay legible
- [x] **`@geolibre/core` and `@geolibre/map` publish to npm**, so another application can build on GeoLibre's store, project schema, and MapLibre layer-sync engine without vendoring the monorepo. See [Maintenance](maintenance.md)
- [x] **An agent skill for driving GeoLibre from outside the app**: `skills/geolibre/` is a SKILL.md plus progressive-disclosure references for the MCP tool surface, the Python API, hand-written project JSON, and the basemap/ramp/format catalog, so an external agent knows which entry point to reach for and in what order to call it. Its copy is guarded by a test against the real registries. See [Agent skill](agent-skill.md)
- [x] **Interactive SamGeo segmentation**, a dockable SAM3 workflow with text, point, box, and automatic modes, reprojecting results into WGS84 so the generated polygons land where the imagery is
- [x] **The Python package speaks Earth Engine and xarray**: `add_ee_layer` turns an authenticated Earth Engine image, collection, feature collection, or feature into a restorable tile layer geemap-style, and a `DataArray` or `Dataset` is materialized as a session-scoped COG that renders directly in the browser. See [Python API](python.md)
- [x] **Every shipped locale is complete again**, three times over: the Whitebox toolbox's 1066 tool names, 45 subcategory labels, and unlocked tool parameters are generated into the catalogs and translated into Simplified Chinese, the SamGeo panel, Whitebox job strings, and the language-pack manager are filled in across all 18 locales, and a later sweep closed the 136 keys that had drifted out of every non-English catalog. See [Internationalization](i18n.md)
- [x] **A tiled archive opens as a group of its source layers**, so a multi-layer PMTiles file lands as one folder of named, individually styleable layers instead of a single opaque row
- [x] **Basemaps are previewed, not just listed**: each raster entry shows a z=2 tile and each keyless style entry shows its background color and then an offscreen MapLibre snapshot, so a basemap can be told apart before it is applied
- [x] **A configurable startup map view** in Settings, so a deployment or a personal install opens where its users work rather than on the world
- [x] **GeoEditor sketches export as a project layer**, carrying their style, opacity, and visibility, so drawn work leaves the editor without being redrawn or re-imported
- [x] **KML folder structure survives import**: placemarks that sit inside a Folder become one layer per folder, the rest stay merged per file, and the import frames the combined extent
- [x] Release downloads are mirrored to GitHub Pages and `web.geolibre.app` moved there, the Model Builder panel maximizes across the map canvas, the annotation toolbar collapses, hosted-site analytics became opt-in at build time (and never ship in the desktop, Jupyter, Docker, or fork builds — see [Privacy](privacy.md)), and the docs gained a [Video Tutorials](tutorials/videos.md) page and a user guide checked against the running app

## v2.9: A tokenless 3D globe, kiosk and classroom deployments, docked service panels, and keyless global elevation

- [x] **The 3D globe no longer needs a Cesium Ion token**, and it finally draws the project's own basemap. The pane used to hide itself unless a token was configured and then ignored the basemap entirely, so a project saved with a globe reopened as a flat map and a dark-themed project kept a bright globe in the corner. Planetary and regional basemaps carry over as raster tile sets, GeoLibre's vector styles map to a keyless raster basemap of matching tone, and the blank basemap draws a bare ellipsoid. A token is now an upgrade rather than a gate: it adds Cesium World Terrain and Ion world imagery
- [x] **The two panes finally agree on scale**: the globe camera aims at the terrain surface rather than the ellipsoid, so a view over high ground stops rendering more than twice as close as its 2D twin. The globe also builds a bare `CesiumWidget` and imports `@cesium/engine` directly instead of the `cesium` barrel, dropping the ten widgets it only switched off again and the Knockout dependency that came with them, and it now has automated coverage for the first time
- [x] **Kiosk and classroom deployments can lock the app down**: a capability model in `@geolibre/core` defines what a build is allowed to do, and the UI, the command palette, the keyboard shortcut layer, and the embed API all enforce it, so a denied action cannot be reached from a menu, a shortcut, or a host page. Denials explain themselves inline rather than silently disabling a control, and per-layer permissions from v2.8 now sit under one model. Processing, sidecar tools, project editing, data loading, plugins, and settings each gate independently
- [x] **Elevation data without an account**: a keyless global DEM downloader mosaics and clips the public AWS Terrain Tiles to the current map view or a bounding box drawn on the map, straight from Processing > GeoLibre Toolbox > Raster, with no API key to obtain and in-flight downloads cancelled when the tool closes
- [x] **Web Services plugins dock like everything else.** The first five moved into the shared dockable panel host, keeping their MapLibre control lifecycle and layer sync, so a catalog browser resizes, collapses, and sits alongside the Layers and Style panels rather than floating over the map
- [x] **Two new open-data catalogs** under Plugins > Web Services: **Planet Open Data**, which opens Planet's disaster releases through the STAC browser with the public catalog preselected, and **Vantor Open Data**, a STAC explorer for pre-event and post-event imagery that filters by event and phase, draws a bounding box, and picks its own COG rendering engine (GPU, WebAssembly, or TiTiler). Catalog plugins that share panel state are now mutually exclusive, and a failed switch restores the plugin it displaced
- [x] **Identify answers for every visible layer at once**, folding vector features and raster pixel values from all visible queryable layers into one grouped, expandable popup, instead of making you pick a layer first and click again
- [x] **Annotation layers are fully editable**: an Elements panel lists what a layer holds, image overlay corners stay synchronized when an annotation moves, and the style controls shown are the ones that apply to the selected element
- [x] **GeoParquet's `geo` metadata is read in full** — `version`, `primary_column`, `encoding`, `geometry_types`, `bbox`, `covering`, and `edges` — alongside the CRS a Parquet 2.0 file records only on its geometry column's GEOMETRY/GEOGRAPHY logical type, which GeoLibre previously could not see at all. A 3D `bbox` is now read minima-first rather than mistaking its ymax for an elevation, and a lon/lat table without geometry is recognized
- [x] **GeoLibre embeds in a Plotly Dash app** through a new `DashMap` component, which pushes project changes into a mounted iframe after the ready handshake the way the Jupyter widget does. See [Python API](python.md)
- [x] **Projects open the way files do**: double-clicking a `.geolibre.json` in the desktop file manager opens it through a file association (with native project events on macOS), and dropping one on the map switches projects, keeping the unsaved-work prompt and reporting a bad file as a project error rather than a failed layer
- [x] **Background controls say what they do**, and a Blank background takes a custom color that survives a style reload and follows the theme by default, without bleeding into the planetary and regional styles that carry their own
- [x] Shift and Shift+Alt reach click selection again, so add and intersect work across multiple features instead of every click replacing the selection; remote zipped Shapefiles load in the web build; and all 18 shipped locales are complete again after the identify, Vantor, and Cesium features landed. See [Internationalization](i18n.md)

## v3.0: Cesium as a first-class rendering engine, dynamic 3D scenes on the globe, ArcGIS write-back, and editable SVG print layouts (current)

- [x] **Cesium can be the primary rendering engine, not just a side pane**: View → Rendering engine switches the main map area between MapLibre 2D and Cesium 3D, saved with the project, so a 3D-first workflow no longer builds a split layout it does not want and keeps a MapLibre map it is not looking at. Behind the switch, the whole app now drives the map through a renderer-neutral `MapEngine` interface with `CesiumEngine` as its second implementation, and menus, tools, and plugins are gated on what the active engine can actually do rather than silently doing nothing. See [Architecture](architecture.md#3d-globe-view-cesiumjs)
- [x] **The globe carries its own chrome**: Reset view, fullscreen, and a scene-mode picker for 3D, 2D, and Columbus views (the flat modes in Web Mercator to match the project map), a native basemap and terrain gallery with Cesium Ion imagery plus keyless Esri and OpenStreetMap styles, cursor coordinates and elevation in the shared status bar, and controls that move between corners like their 2D counterparts
- [x] **Vector layers look and behave the same on the globe as on the map**: per-feature categorized, graduated, rule-based, expression, proportional, and marker symbology compiled from the same paint expressions the 2D map uses; field and expression labels; point clustering and batched rendering for large point layers; polygon extrusion and true Z elevation instead of clamping everything to the ground; layer filters, the Time Slider clock, and story-map opacity fades; and click popups, hover tooltips, identify, and highlighting through the same popup designer
- [x] **Almost every layer kind reaches the globe**: COG, raster PMTiles, local MBTiles, and native tile fetchers through one protocol bridge; vector tiles, vector PMTiles, and vector MBTiles draped through a hidden MapLibre renderer so their styles match exactly; ArcGIS MapServer, WMTS, and image overlays; and I3S scene layers, LiDAR point clouds, and Gaussian splat tilesets loaded natively by Cesium
- [x] **Cesium-native content beyond parity**: Cesium Ion tilesets and imagery by asset id (with quick picks for Cesium OSM Buildings, Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles, and Asset Depot samples), 3D Tiles classified from the Style panel through a translator to `Cesium3DTileStyle`, time-dynamic **CZML** scenes for orbits, trajectories, and moving entities synchronized with the globe clock, and native **KML/KMZ** that keeps document styling, overlays, and network links. See [Optional 3D globe credentials](getting-started.md#optional-3d-globe-credentials-cesium-ion)
- [x] **Tools and plugins follow you onto the globe**: drawing extents and dragging model pins, screenshots, print layouts, video and camera-tour recording that wait for terrain and tiles to settle, an Elevation Profile sampled from the active Cesium terrain, and native globe branches for the Sun simulation, Atmospheric Effects, Flight Simulator, Clouds, and Precipitation plugins. Plugins declare which engines they support, and switching renderers suspends the unsupported ones while keeping their settings. See [Plugin API](plugin-api.md)
- [x] **Edits to an ArcGIS Feature Service go back to the service**: Layer actions → Save edits to ArcGIS service submits additions, attribute and geometry changes, and deletions through `applyEdits`, validates against the service's capabilities and fields, reconciles partial failures and server-assigned ids, and refuses to retry a write whose outcome it cannot confirm
- [x] **Editable SVG print layouts**: a single-page Print Layout exports to SVG, so the title, legend, colorbar, scale bar, north arrow, and other layout elements open as real vectors in Inkscape or Illustrator for final touches
- [x] **Rasters stretch to what is on screen**: an unclassified raster can recompute its display range from the current viewport by min/max, 5th to 95th percentile, or mean ± 2 standard deviations, and keeps doing so as you pan with the Style panel closed. Discrete raster classes also gained their own color and opacity controls, and any loaded COG layer can be picked as the 3D terrain source
- [x] **Select by Expression can filter a layer, not just select from it**: a validated expression becomes a persistent, project-saved layer filter that composes with time, embed, quick, and rule filters on both engines and in style exports. See [Project format](project-format.md)
- [x] **New ways to find and reach data**: a **Portolan** catalog browser that opens the public Portolan Registry, an OGC **CSW** catalog search that hands WMS, WFS, and ArcGIS results to prefilled Add Data forms, a **USGS NLDI** panel for flowline tracing, hydrolocation, basin analysis, and navigation to gages, dams, and water-quality sites along the network (see [USGS NLDI](user-guide/usgs-nldi.md)), local GLB and glTF model import embedded in the project, and a project gallery that loads more as you scroll
- [x] **A Dimensions plugin** draws CAD-style linear and angular dimension lines whose endpoints snap to vector vertices and stay associated when those vertices are edited
- [x] **Point heatmaps take a color ramp and an attribute weight**, carried through saved styles, style exports, and the automatic legend
- [x] **Links and automation**: coordinate URLs (`?lat=&lon=&zoom=` and compact `?12/40.7/-74.0`) plus Android `geo:` intents open GeoLibre at a place, a `loading=true` parameter exposes screenshot readiness for headless capture (see [Embedding & Sharing](user-guide/embedding.md)), external plugins register AI Assistant tools with plain JSON Schema, and the Python package authors popups, tooltips, marker symbology, and WMS/WMTS bounds (see [Python API](python.md))
- [x] Field Collection takes multiple photos per observation, numeric labels format with thousands separators, the buffer tool runs inward or across the boundary, saved style presets can be renamed, and the Share dialog warns up front that local-file layers will be missing from a shared map

## Plugin marketplace and registry (design)

This captures the design for the `v1.0` "Plugin marketplace / registry" item. It
builds on the existing external-plugin foundation, the `plugin.json` manifest
contract, HTTPS manifest-URL loading, the desktop app data `plugins/` scan, and
the bundled `public/plugins/` drop-in mechanism, and it relates to the "External
plugin package distribution workflow" item.

### Goal

Let users discover, install, update, and remove trusted external plugins from a
curated registry without hand-entering manifest URLs, on both the desktop and
web builds, while keeping the existing trust model in which plugins are trusted
code.

### Registry

- A curated, versioned index published as static JSON (for example
  `registry.json` hosted on `geolibre.app`, or generated from a GitHub
  repository of submissions). No live backend is required for the MVP.
- Each entry carries `id`, `name`, `version`, `description`, `author`,
  `homepage`, `manifestUrl`, `categories`, `minGeoLibreVersion`, and optional
  `screenshots`.
- The index is fetched over HTTPS and cached; entries point at the same
  `plugin.json` manifests the existing loader already understands.

### Browse and install UI

- A standalone Manage Plugins dialog (Settings menu > Manage Plugins), modeled
  on QGIS, has All / Installed / Not installed / Upgradeable / Settings sections.
  The four browse sections list registry entries with search and per-entry
  install, installed, and update states; the Settings section manages plugin
  sources.
- Install reuses the current external-plugin loader: it resolves the entry's
  `manifestUrl`, validates it, and registers the plugin.
  - Desktop: download the bundle into the app data `plugins/<id>/` directory so
    it persists and loads on startup through the existing scan.
  - Web: record the entry's `manifestUrl` in desktop settings (and, for shared
    projects, in the project `plugins.manifestUrls`) so it loads on next open.
- Remove drops the recorded manifest URL and unregisters the plugin at runtime
  (tearing down any active control), so the change takes effect without a
  restart. (The MVP records manifest URLs rather than downloading bundles; the
  desktop bundle-download path above is a later enhancement.)

### Updates and versioning

- Compare the installed `version` against the registry entry, surface an update
  available state, and offer a one-click update that re-fetches the bundle.
- Honor `minGeoLibreVersion` so incompatible plugins are flagged, not installed.

### Trust and security

- The registry is an allowlist; only curated entries are offered for install.
- HTTPS-only manifests (the existing `isAllowedPluginManifestUrl` rule).
- Explicit user consent on install, because plugin entries execute as trusted
  code (the desktop CSP permits `blob:` script execution by design).
- The curated registry and explicit install consent are the primary controls.

### Relationship to bundled plugins

- Bundled `public/plugins/<id>/` drop-ins remain the zero-config way to ship
  first-party or private plugins inside a build. The marketplace covers
  discoverable, user-installed third-party plugins; the two are complementary
  and share the same `plugin.json` contract and loader.

### Phasing

1. Curated static registry plus browse and install through manifest URLs
   (reuses the current loader; records the manifest URL in settings). **Done.**
2. Version checks, update and removal flows.
3. Submission workflow for third-party authors.

### Implementation (phase 1)

The MVP ships in the desktop app and, because the same frontend serves the web
build, works in both:

- `apps/geolibre-desktop/src/lib/plugin-registry.ts` fetches and normalizes a
  registry (`{ "plugins": [...] }`), resolving each entry's `manifestUrl`
  against the registry location. The registry URL is
  `VITE_GEOLIBRE_PLUGIN_REGISTRY_URL` or, by default, the hosted registry at
  `https://plugins.geolibre.app/plugin-registry.json`.
- `apps/geolibre-desktop/src/components/layout/ManagePluginsDialog.tsx` is a
  standalone dialog (Settings menu > Manage Plugins) with All / Installed / Not
  installed / Upgradeable / Settings sections: search, install, a confirm step
  before uninstall, an Update action when a newer version is published,
  `minGeoLibreVersion` compatibility checks, and inline error handling. The
  Settings section manages additional local directories and manual manifest
  URLs. All actions apply immediately (live).
- Installing records the entry's manifest URL in the plugin manifest URL list,
  so the existing external-plugin loader fetches and registers it. No new trust
  path is introduced. Uninstalling (after confirmation) unregisters the plugin
  at runtime — tearing down any active map control — so the Plugins menu updates
  without a reload. Update re-fetches the manifest URL and re-registers the
  published version in place, fetching the new version before tearing down the
  old one so a failed update leaves the installed plugin intact.
- The registry and plugin bundles live in the
  [opengeos/geolibre-plugins](https://github.com/opengeos/geolibre-plugins) repo,
  published to GitHub Pages at `plugins.geolibre.app`; it ships a `sample/`
  template and maintainers add curated entries there.
