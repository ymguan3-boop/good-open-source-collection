# Supported Data Formats

This page lists GeoLibre's supported data formats, services, and database
sources, including how to open them and the main limitations. The tables
reflect the default MapLibre renderer; some specialized layers are unavailable
with other renderers. See [Adding Data](user-guide/adding-data.md) for the menu
workflow and [Projects](user-guide/projects.md) for saving and reopening data.

## Vector and tabular files

| Format | Extensions or source | How to add it | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GeoJSON | `.geojson`, `.json`, GeoJSON URL | Vector Layer | Geometry and feature attributes; also supports drag and drop. |
| GeoParquet / Parquet | `.geoparquet`, `.parquet` | GeoParquet Layer or Vector Layer | Reads geometry and CRS metadata; supported coordinate-column tables can become points. |
| FlatGeobuf | `.fgb`, `.flatgeobuf` | FlatGeobuf Layer or Vector Layer | Spatially indexed vector files, including remote URLs. |
| GeoPackage | `.gpkg` | Vector Layer | Select feature tables from a multi-layer file. |
| Shapefile | `.shp` with companion files, or `.zip` | Vector Layer | Keep `.shx`, `.dbf`, and `.prj` companions together; use a ZIP for browser imports. |
| GML | `.gml` | Vector Layer | Imported through the vector reader. |
| MapInfo TAB | `.tab` and companion files | Vector Layer | Requires access to the dataset's companion files. |
| KML / KMZ | `.kml`, `.kmz` | KML / KMZ Layer or Vector Layer | Supports folders, styles, ground overlays, embedded models, and Super-Overlays; behavior depends on the renderer. |
| GPX | `.gpx` | GPX Layer | Waypoints, tracks, and routes can become separate layers. |
| LandXML | `.xml`, `.landxml`, LandXML URL | LandXML Layer | Imports TIN surfaces, horizontal alignments, vertical profile metadata, and survey points; projected data requires a source CRS. |
| Delimited text | CSV, TSV, and custom-delimited text | Delimited Text Layer | Map coordinate columns, specify their CRS, or geocode address columns. CSV without coordinates can also be loaded as a table. |
| Excel | Excel workbooks | File import | Select a worksheet and coordinate columns to create point features. |
| AutoCAD | `.dxf`, `.dwg` | CAD (DXF/DWG) Layer | Select drawing layers and the source CRS. Coordinate Z values are kept and rendered in 3D unless you turn that off. |
| Esri File Geodatabase | `.gdb` folder | File Geodatabase (GDB) | Desktop folder access; select a feature class. |
| OpenStreetMap PBF | `.osm.pbf` | OSM PBF Layer | Reads an extract in the browser and adds the selected features. |
| Encoded polyline | Encoded strings or text files | Encoded Polyline | Precision 5 and 6, including Google, OSRM, Valhalla, and Mapbox conventions. |

Vector import generally reprojects a known source CRS to EPSG:4326. Multi-file
formats need their companion files, and large feature collections may require
substantial memory. Additional formats depend on the bundled vector reader;
see [vector import details](user-guide/adding-data.md#files).

## Raster, tile archives, and multidimensional arrays

| Format | Extensions or source | How to add it | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GeoTIFF / Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) | `.tif`, `.tiff`, remote URL | Raster Layer | Numerical pixel inspection, styling, export, and raster analysis. COGs support partial remote reads. |
| PMTiles | `.pmtiles`, remote URL | PMTiles Layer | Vector and raster tile archives. Multiple vector source layers can be added separately. |
| MBTiles | `.mbtiles` | MBTiles Layer | Local raster or vector tile archives; requires desktop filesystem access. |
| Zarr | Remote store or local folder | Zarr Layer | Multidimensional arrays with variable and dimension selection; also supports Icechunk repositories. |
| NetCDF-4 / HDF5 | Local scientific data files | NetCDF / HDF | Select variables and their spatial, time, and vertical dimensions. |
| Cloud-Optimized NetCDF / HDF | Kerchunk references | NetCDF / HDF | Reads referenced chunks from remote data. |

## Web services and catalogs

| Service | How to add it | Data and limitations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| XYZ tiles | XYZ Layer | Raster or vector tiles from a `{z}/{x}/{y}` URL template. |
| WMS | WMS Layer | Rendered map images; discover layers and query GetFeatureInfo where supported. |
| [WCS 1.0.0](#wcs-raster-subsets) | WCS Layer | Numerical GeoTIFF subsets with chosen extent and pixel dimensions; requires EPSG:4326 request/output support. |
| WFS | WFS Layer | Vector features with feature-type discovery and optional refresh. |
| WMTS | WMTS Layer | Map tiles from a Web Map Tile Service. |
| OGC API - Features | OGC API - Features | Browse collections and load their features. |
| OGC API - Tiles | OGC Vector Tiles | Vector tile services. |
| ArcGIS FeatureServer | ArcGIS Layer: Feature layer | Features and attributes from a service URL or portal item. |
| ArcGIS VectorTileServer | ArcGIS Layer: Vector tile layer | Vector tiles and their styling. |
| ArcGIS MapServer | ArcGIS Layer: Map service | Cached tiles or rendered exports, with sublayer selection. |
| ArcGIS ImageServer | ArcGIS Layer: Image service | Rendered imagery with advertised raster functions or a custom rendering rule. Use WCS when numerical raster subsets are needed and the service exposes WCS. |
| GeoRSS | GeoRSS Layer | Geographic features from a feed URL or file. |
| STAC | STAC Layer | Search catalogs and load raster assets. |
| OGC CSW 2.0.2 | CSW Catalog | Search metadata records; open supported linked GeoJSON, WMS, WFS, and ArcGIS resources. |

Remote services must allow browser cross-origin requests (CORS) for the hosted
web app. Some services need credentials or impose their own request limits.
Provider-specific catalogs, including NASA, USGS, ArcGIS Hub, Socrata, and CKAN,
are described in [Web Services](user-guide/web-services.md) and
[Data Integrations](user-guide/data-integrations.md).

## Project formats

| Format | Entry point | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GeoLibre project (`.geolibre.json`) | Project > Open | Layers, styles, groups, and map state; remote sources and local file references still need to be accessible. |
| QGIS project (`.qgs`, `.qgz`) | Project > Import | Imports supported layers and settings; reports skipped sources. Local paths require desktop access. |
| ArcGIS Pro project or map (`.aprx`, `.mapx`) | Project > Import | Imports supported layers and settings; see the [project import guide](user-guide/projects.md#importing-an-arcgis-pro-project) for requirements. |

## WCS raster subsets

Use **Add Data > WCS Layer** to download numerical raster data from an OGC
Web Coverage Service. Unlike a rendered WMS image, the returned GeoTIFF retains
band values for pixel inspection, raster styling, export, and raster analysis.

1. Enter the service's WCS endpoint and click **Retrieve coverages**.
2. Select a coverage. Choose **Use view**, **Use coverage extent**, or enter
   west, south, east, and north in longitude/latitude degrees.
3. Set the output width and height in pixels and click **Add layer**.
4. Use the layer's pixel inspector or raster tools. Export the raster as a
   GeoTIFF to keep a copy of the downloaded data.

The sample selector includes USGS 3DEP elevation and the Illinois statewide
LiDAR DEM. Each sample selects a small area near Elkhart, Illinois. A bare
ArcGIS ImageServer REST URL is also accepted and converted to its WCS endpoint.
This is a convenience; GeoServer and other WCS endpoints use the same protocol.

### Supported requests

The initial implementation supports **WCS 1.0.0** KVP `GetCapabilities`,
`DescribeCoverage`, and `GetCoverage`. Services must advertise GeoTIFF output
and EPSG:4326 for both the request and response. Unsupported versions, formats,
and coordinate systems produce an error before the coverage download. WCS 1.1
and 2.x requests are not yet implemented.

The selected extent and pixel dimensions determine output resolution. The
server may resample values; this is not a guarantee of native-resolution data.
Each dimension must be 1–4096 pixels, with a 128 MB download limit; coverage
listings and descriptions are capped at 32 MB. The server may impose smaller
limits. Areas crossing the antimeridian must be split into
two requests. Each load is a fixed subset; panning does not fetch more coverage.

Downloads become file-backed raster layers and follow the same persistence
rules as other imported GeoTIFFs. Export the raster before ending the session;
saving only the project does not retain the downloaded raster bytes.

Desktop requests use native HTTP. The hosted web app requires the service to
allow browser cross-origin requests (CORS). Development uses the existing
service proxy, so a successful development test alone does not establish CORS
support on the hosted site.
