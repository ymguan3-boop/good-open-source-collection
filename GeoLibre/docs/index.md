    <p class="eyebrow">Cloud-native GIS platform</p>
    <h1>A free and open-source, lightweight, cloud-native GIS platform for visualizing, exploring, and analyzing geospatial data.</h1>
    <p class="hero__lead">
      GeoLibre runs everywhere you do, in the web browser, on the desktop, on
      mobile, and inside Jupyter notebooks, all while keeping your data local
      and private. It is built with Tauri, React, TypeScript, MapLibre GL JS,
      DuckDB-WASM Spatial, and deck.gl, with four interchangeable rendering
      engines, fast local and cloud-native data
      work, project files, styling, plugins, and modern geospatial workflows.

## What GeoLibre does today

<div class="feature-grid" markdown>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### MapLibre map workspace

Pan, zoom, rotate, and tilt a MapLibre map with OpenFreeMap basemaps or a blank background. Toggle controls for navigation, globe, terrain, geolocation, scale, attribution, and logo, plus on-map tools like Measure, Bookmark, Minimap, View State, and Field Collection for capturing point, line, and polygon observations with a custom form by GPS or map tap.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### Local and remote data

Load local and remote vector and raster data, then inspect and edit attributes in a table with a field calculator, charts, statistics, and export to GeoJSON, GeoParquet, Shapefile, GeoPackage, or CSV. Style layers with categorized, graduated, expression, heatmap, and clustering renderers, group and reorder the layer stack with undo/redo, and save or share `.geolibre.json` projects.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### Plugins and marketplace

Activate built-in plugins for layer control, basemaps, MapLibre components, swipe, street view, time slider, Overture Maps, LiDAR, GeoAgent, GeoEditor, and atmosphere effects, and install, update, or remove external plugins from the built-in marketplace.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### Advanced layer formats

Add Data covers XYZ, WMS, WFS, WMTS, ArcGIS, and STAC services; GeoParquet, FlatGeobuf, PMTiles, Zarr, and OpenStreetMap PBF; COG, GeoTIFF, Cloud-Optimized NetCDF/HDF, and MBTiles rasters; LiDAR, Gaussian splats, 3D Tiles (including authenticated tilesets), georeferenced video, and deck.gl layers; and DuckDB and PostgreSQL databases.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### 1,000+ geoprocessing tools

Run **1,000+ geoprocessing tools** — vector, raster, remote sensing, hydrology, terrain, LiDAR, conversion, network, and projection — from the Whitebox toolbox, browsable by category in the Processing menu. They execute in the browser on a WebAssembly runtime with raster and vector I/O, so there is no Python sidecar to install and the full set works on the web, desktop, and Android.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### SQL Workspace

Run DuckDB Spatial SQL in the browser against loaded layers, local files, and remote URLs, or query with the in-browser PostGIS (PGlite) and Apache Sedona engines. Bare URLs auto-wrap into the matching reader and stream over HTTP range requests. Includes sample queries, query history, and adding results to the map or exporting them as CSV or GeoParquet.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### Vector tools

Geometry tools under Processing → GeoLibre Toolbox → Vector — buffer, centroids, convex hull, dissolve, bounding box, simplify, smooth, regular grid, clip, overlay (intersect/difference/union), spatial and attribute joins, selection, Voronoi/Delaunay, and H3 grids and binning — run in the browser with Turf.js, with an optional GeoPandas sidecar engine. A Spatial Statistics toolbox and a batch runner with model/pipeline chaining round out Processing.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### Raster tools

Raster tools under Processing → GeoLibre Toolbox → Raster — hillshade, slope, aspect, reproject, resample, clip, polygonize, contour, zonal and focal statistics, raster calculator, reclassify, mosaic, and a Spectral Index toolbox (NDVI, NDWI, EVI with band presets) — run on a rasterio sidecar with a client-side fallback. Includes a Georeferencer and single-band or RGB raster styling.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### Python and Jupyter

Embed the full GeoLibre app in a Jupyter notebook with the [`geolibre`](python.md) Python package, driving the map through an expanded leafmap-style API that syncs both ways so UI edits read back from Python. An in-app Python Console scripts the app, and a docked [Notebook panel](notebook.md) runs Jupyter beside the map — JupyterLite on the web, a JupyterLab server on desktop.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### R, Quarto, and Shiny

Build interactive maps in RStudio, Quarto, R Markdown, and Shiny with the [`geolibre`](r.md) R package. Add GeoJSON, `sf` objects, and remote rasters, control the camera, and exchange portable `.geolibre.json` projects with the web and desktop applications.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### AI Assistant

Chat with your data: a natural-language [assistant](user-guide/ai-assistant.md) that turns plain-English requests into GeoLibre operations — Spatial SQL, symbology, add or remove data, and map control — applied through the app so they stay auditable and undoable. Provider-pluggable (Google Gemini, Anthropic, OpenAI) with your own API key, disabled until configured.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### Collaboration and story maps

Edit the same project with others in real time ([collaboration](collaboration.md) MVP; requires `VITE_GEOLIBRE_COLLAB_URL`), and build scroll-driven [story maps](user-guide/storymaps.md) with a presenter view and a standalone HTML export you can publish anywhere.
</div>

</div>

## GeoLibre on the web

GeoLibre Web is the full browser version of the GeoLibre app, ready to use with nothing to install. It is great for exploring the map, loading browser-selected vector data supported by DuckDB-WASM Spatial, adding URL-based layers, styling layers, and testing plugins. Desktop-only file dialogs, local MBTiles, local raster reads, and filesystem save/open operations still require the installed Tauri app.

!!! note "Hosted on GitHub Pages, private by design"
    GeoLibre Web is a static site deployed on GitHub Pages and runs entirely in your browser. There is no server account, and the data you load is processed client-side in your browser session. Data leaves your browser only when you choose to add a remote URL or explicitly share a project. The hosted site measures page visits with Google Analytics, which never sees the data you load (see the [Privacy Policy](privacy.md#website-analytics)). A build you host yourself has no analytics at all.

    If your data cannot be public at all, run the same web build on your own server next to your data. See [Self-Hosting & Private Data](self-hosting.md).

Open a project by passing a public `.geolibre.json` URL with the `url` query parameter:

```text
https://web.geolibre.app/?url=https://share.geolibre.app/giswqs/3d-tiles.geolibre.json
```

You can also open hosted data directly. `data` accepts GeoJSON, GeoParquet, PMTiles, REST endpoints returning GeoJSON or ZIP, ZIP archives containing multiple GeoJSON files, and COGs. Add `style` to apply hosted vector or raster symbology:

```text
https://web.geolibre.app/?data=https://assets.geolibre.app/data/places.geojson&style=https://assets.geolibre.app/data/sample.style.json
```

Vector layers can produce a compatible file from **Layer actions → Styles → Export GeoLibre URL style**, and apply it again with **Import style from file (GeoLibre URL / Mapbox GL / SLD / QML)…**, or with **Import style from text…** by pasting the style itself.

For narrow embeds, add `?layout=compact` to the demo URL to use icon-only toolbar buttons and hide project metadata:

```text
https://web.geolibre.app/?url=https://share.geolibre.app/giswqs/3d-tiles.geolibre.json&layout=compact
```

For map-focused embeds, add `&panels=none` to hide the Layers, Style, and Attribute table panels:

```text
https://web.geolibre.app/?url=https://share.geolibre.app/giswqs/3d-tiles.geolibre.json&layout=compact&panels=none
```

Use `toolbar=icons` when you only want icon-only toolbar buttons, or `toolbar=none` to hide the top toolbar while retaining panels and the status bar. `panels=hidden`, `panels=hide`, `panels=off`, and `hidePanels=true` are accepted aliases for hiding panels.

Use `panels=collapsed` to keep the Layers and Style icon rails visible while
starting both panels collapsed.

For a fully chrome-free, map-only embed, add `&maponly` to hide the toolbar menu, all panels, and the status bar:

```text
https://web.geolibre.app/?url=https://share.geolibre.app/giswqs/3d-tiles.geolibre.json&maponly
```

For a read-only embed that viewers can still explore, use `&layout=viewer`. It keeps the Layers list, View and Controls menus, basemaps, and search/identify, and hides everything that would change the project:

```text
https://web.geolibre.app/?url=https://share.geolibre.app/giswqs/3d-tiles.geolibre.json&layout=viewer
```

Other parameters control the toolbar, panels, and theme. See [Embedding & Sharing](user-guide/embedding.md) for the full parameter reference and `<iframe>` examples.
