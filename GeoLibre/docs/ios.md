# iOS

GeoLibre runs as a native iOS app built from the same React codebase via **Tauri
v2 mobile** — no separate app. The webview UI (WKWebView) is bundled in the app,
so the shell works offline; map tiles and the heavier engines are fetched on
demand (same as the desktop and Android builds).

## Install

GeoLibre is published on the
[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/geolibre/id6796039674) for iPhone and
iPad. The Store build is signed and updates automatically:

[Get GeoLibre on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/geolibre/id6796039674){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

GeoLibre does not publish a sideloadable `.ipa` for end users; the App Store
listing, and TestFlight for beta builds, are how it is distributed. Each release
*does* carry a `GeoLibre_<version>_ios_app-store.ipa` asset, but unlike the
Android APKs that is the App Store **submission** package — archived next to the
tag so a submission stays reproducible — and it cannot be installed on a device.
The rest of this page is for developers building the app themselves, which has to
happen on a Mac (iOS cannot be cross-compiled from Linux).

The signing and archiving pipeline behind that listing runs two ways, and either
produces a submittable `.ipa` — bundle id `org.geolibre.app`, signed by *Apple
Distribution*, `get-task-allow=false`, an embedded App Store provisioning
profile, the merged location usage string, and the web assets embedded in the
binary:

- **Locally** on a Mac (Xcode 26.6 / iOS SDK 26.5): `tauri ios init` → unsigned
  archive → `xcodebuild -exportArchive`.
- **In CI**, on a `macos-15` runner (Xcode 26.3): it imports the certificate and
  profile from the `APPLE_IOS_*` secrets, archives, exports under manual
  signing, verifies the signature, and publishes the `geolibre-ios-ipa`
  artifact.

## What works on iOS vs desktop

Same split as Android. The iOS build ships the full map workspace, Add Data, the
Vector tools (Turf.js / in-browser GeoPandas via Pyodide), the SQL Workspace
(DuckDB-WASM and PGlite/PostGIS), the Python Console (Pyodide), geocoding,
statistics, the AI assistant, story maps, and plugins.

Tools that depend on a **local desktop process** are hidden on mobile because
iOS has no Python sidecar or local helper binaries and its sandbox forbids
spawning subprocesses:

- Processing → GeoLibre Toolbox → **Raster**, **Conversion**, **AI Segmentation**
  (all need the Python sidecar). The Whitebox geoprocessing toolbox runs in
  WebAssembly, needs no sidecar, and stays available.
- Add Data → **PostgreSQL** (served by the local Martin tile server)

These are gated by a user-agent `isMobile()` check (which already matches
iPhone/iPad), so the Add Data menu and the Layer panel's add-data group never
offer them. Everything else runs client-side.

PostgreSQL has one entry point that check does not cover: the Browser panel
keeps its **Databases** section on every platform for discovery, so its ＋ still
opens the PostgreSQL dialog. The dialog gates on `isDesktopRuntime()`
(`isTauri() && !isMobile()`) rather than on `isTauri()` alone, so on iOS it
shows the "requires GeoLibre Desktop" notice and disables Connect instead of
calling a sidecar that cannot exist (GeoLibre#2091).

## Location permission (required)

This is the one place iOS differs sharply from Android. Android's geolocation
plugin declares the runtime permission and the OS shows a generic dialog; **iOS
terminates the app the instant it requests location if no usage-description
string is present.** GeoLibre supplies it in
`src-tauri/Info.ios.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>GeoLibre uses your location to center the map, capture GPS points during Field Collection, and record GPS tracks.</string>
```

Tauri merges `Info.ios.plist` into the generated
`gen/apple/geolibre-desktop_iOS/Info.plist` at build time. `gen/apple` is git-ignored, so
this file is the durable home for the string — the same reason Android's manifest
permissions come from the plugin rather than a hand-edited, regenerated manifest.
It covers all three location consumers: Field Collection, GPS Tracking, and the
Controls → GeoLocate map control. After a build, confirm the key survived the
merge (see *Build* below).

## Minimum iOS version

GeoLibre targets **iOS 15.0**, set once in
`apps/geolibre-desktop/src-tauri/tauri.ios.conf.json`:

```json
"bundle": { "iOS": { "minimumSystemVersion": "15.0" } }
```

Tauri templates that value into the generated `gen/apple/project.yml` as
XcodeGen's `deploymentTarget.iOS`, which Xcode turns into
`IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` and finally the app's `MinimumOSVersion`. There is
nothing to hand-edit in the generated project, and nothing in `Info.ios.plist`:
Xcode writes the plist key from the build setting.

Leave the key out and the **Tauri CLI's own default applies**, which is `14.0`.
That is below Apple's floor: starting Spring 2027, App Store Connect refuses any
upload with a `MinimumOSVersion` under 15.0. Until then it accepts the build and
sends a warning email afterward (`ITMS-90068`), which is how version 2.5.0
build 7 was found to have shipped at 14.0. That build is the one that was
approved, so the live App Store listing still reads *iOS 14.0 or later*; the
listing picks up 15.0 with the next release.

Because `gen/apple` is generated, a change here only takes effect once the
project is regenerated. CI regenerates on every run, so it picks the value up
automatically; locally, regenerate it yourself (paths relative to
`apps/geolibre-desktop`, as everywhere else in this document):

```bash
cd apps/geolibre-desktop
rm -rf src-tauri/gen/apple
npx tauri ios init

# What init generated:
grep -A2 'deploymentTarget:' src-tauri/gen/apple/project.yml

# What a build actually shipped. `MinimumOSVersion` exists only in the *built*
# app, since Xcode writes it from the build setting; it is not in the generated
# source Info.plist. So this needs an archive, which `init` alone does not
# produce.
npx tauri ios build --no-sign
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Print :MinimumOSVersion' \
  src-tauri/gen/apple/build/geolibre-desktop_iOS.xcarchive/Products/Applications/GeoLibre.app/Info.plist
```

The CI job asserts this in two places (see *Continuous integration*): the
configured value against Apple's floor and against the generated `project.yml`
right after `ios init`, and then the exported `.ipa`'s `MinimumOSVersion`, which
is the copy App Store Connect actually reads.

Raising the floor further is a product decision, not a technical one. iOS 15 is
the last release for the iPhone 6s/7 and iPad Air 2 generation, so 16.0 would
drop those devices in exchange for a newer WebKit baseline.

## Toolchain setup (one time)

You need a **Mac** with **Xcode** (from the App Store; open it once to accept the
license and install the iOS platform), the command-line tools, CocoaPods, and the
Rust iOS targets.

```bash
xcode-select --install                 # command-line tools (if not already)
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
brew install cocoapods                 # or `gem install cocoapods`

# Rust device + simulator targets (install rustup first if needed)
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim x86_64-apple-ios
```

`aarch64-apple-ios` is real devices and the App Store `.ipa`;
`aarch64-apple-ios-sim` is the simulator on Apple Silicon Macs.

## Build

```bash
cd apps/geolibre-desktop
npx tauri ios init                     # generate src-tauri/gen/apple (once)
npx tauri ios dev                      # run in the simulator / on a tethered device
npx tauri ios build --no-sign          # unsigned .ipa + .xcarchive (no Apple account needed)
```

- `gen/apple` is generated (git-ignored) and regenerated on demand. `init`
  applies `tauri.ios.conf.json` (bundle id, deployment target, drops the Python
  backend); `Info.ios.plist` (the location string) is merged later, by
  `tauri ios build`/`dev`, as noted below.
- The app is named **GeoLibre** on iOS (the desktop build is "GeoLibre Desktop")
  and uses the bundle id **`org.geolibre.app`**, both set via
  `src-tauri/tauri.ios.conf.json` — the same override pattern and reasoning as
  Android (`identifier` in `tauri.conf.json` stays `org.geolibre.desktop` so it
  keeps keying desktop settings and the Linux/macOS packaging).
- Verify the location string landed after a build:

  ```bash
  /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Print :NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription' \
    src-tauri/gen/apple/geolibre-desktop_iOS/Info.plist
  ```

  The merge happens during `tauri ios build`/`dev`, **not** during `ios init` —
  straight after `init` the generated plist does not contain the key yet, and
  that is expected. Note also that the Xcode project, target, and plist
  directory are named from the **Cargo package** (`geolibre-desktop` in
  `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`), not from `productName`. The user-visible app name and
  bundle id still come from `tauri.ios.conf.json` — they land as `PRODUCT_NAME:
  GeoLibre` and `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER: org.geolibre.app` in the generated
  `project.yml`.

## Signing

Every build that runs on a real device or reaches the App Store must be signed —
there is no debug-keystore shortcut like Android's. You need:

1. An **Apple Developer Program** membership ($99/year).
2. A **signing certificate** (Apple Distribution for App Store; Apple Development
   for device testing), exported from Keychain as a `.p12`.
3. A **provisioning profile** for the `org.geolibre.app` app id.
4. Your **Team ID** (App Store Connect → Membership).

Locally, opening `gen/apple/geolibre-desktop.xcodeproj` in Xcode once and enabling
"Automatically manage signing" with your team is the simplest path. For CI, the
identity is imported from secrets (below).

> **The local and CI identities are not interchangeable.** The export recipe
> above lets Xcode create a **Cloud Managed** Apple Distribution certificate and
> an Xcode-managed profile. Neither can be fed to CI: a cloud-managed identity
> has no exportable private key, so there is no `.p12` to base64, and CI's
> manual-signing export rejects an Xcode-managed profile outright
> (*"is Xcode managed, but signing settings require a manually managed
> profile"*). For CI you must create a **separate, manually managed** pair in the
> Developer portal — an Apple Distribution certificate from a CSR you generate in
> Keychain Access (so you hold the private key and can export the `.p12`), plus
> an App Store provisioning profile for `org.geolibre.app` bound to it. Holding
> both a cloud-managed and a manual distribution certificate at once is fine and
> normal.

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ios.yml` runs on `macos-15` on each published GitHub release
(and on demand via "Run workflow"). Because iOS can't be cross-compiled from
Linux, this is the only mobile workflow that needs a macOS runner. The image is
not free to choose — see the Xcode floor below.

- **With Apple signing secrets set**, it imports the identity into a throwaway
  keychain, archives **unsigned**, exports a signed `.ipa` under manual signing,
  verifies the bundle id, the signature, the build number shape and the
  `MinimumOSVersion`, and uploads it as the `geolibre-ios-ipa` artifact — plus,
  on a published release, as the `GeoLibre_<version>_ios_app-store.ipa` release
  asset, which outlives the artifact's 14-day retention:
  - `APPLE_IOS_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` — `base64 -i dist.p12`
  - `APPLE_IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`
  - `APPLE_IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64` — `base64 -i profile.mobileprovision`
  - `APPLE_TEAM_ID` — **reused** from the existing macOS/Homebrew signing
    secrets; the Team ID is account-wide.
- **Without them**, it falls back to a no-signing **compile check**
  (`cargo build --lib --target aarch64-apple-ios`) so CI still catches iOS build
  breakage; it just can't produce an installable `.ipa`. A release run in that
  state attaches nothing and logs a warning saying which secrets were missing,
  rather than failing the release.

### Reusing the macOS/Homebrew signing secrets?

Only the **Team ID**. The repo's release workflow already signs and notarizes the
macOS build for the Homebrew cask, but its `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` is a **Developer ID
Application** certificate — that type signs macOS apps distributed *outside* the
App Store and **cannot sign an iOS app**. iOS needs its own **Apple Distribution**
certificate and a **provisioning profile** (Developer ID distribution has
neither), so those are the `APPLE_IOS_*` secrets above, deliberately named apart
from the macOS ones to avoid feeding in the wrong cert/password. The good news:
they're created under the **same paid Apple Developer account** at no extra cost —
add an Apple Distribution certificate and an App Store provisioning profile for
`org.geolibre.app` in the Developer portal, and reuse the existing `APPLE_TEAM_ID`.

> **Why the job archives and exports as two steps.** It archives with
> `npx tauri ios build --no-sign` and then signs in a separate
> `xcodebuild -exportArchive` step using **manual** signing, for the reason given
> under *Build*: `tauri ios build --export-method` cannot sign this project,

The `workflow_dispatch` `export_method` input picks the export path
(`app-store-connect` for TestFlight/App Store, `release-testing` for ad-hoc
registered devices, `debugging` for development).

## Run and test a local build

- **Simulator:** `npx tauri ios dev` and pick a simulator, or open the Xcode
  project and Run. No paid account needed for the simulator.
- **Your own device:** tether it, open `gen/apple/geolibre-desktop.xcodeproj` in Xcode,
  select the device, and Run (a free Apple ID allows 7-day device signing).
- **Testers:** distribute a signed build through **TestFlight** (upload the `.ipa`
  via Xcode Organizer or Transporter, then invite testers in App Store Connect).

## Publishing to the App Store

GeoLibre is **live on the
[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/geolibre/id6796039674)**, so the one-time
onboarding below is finished; each step it covers is marked *(Done.)* and only
needs revisiting when something it declares changes. Every subsequent release
repeats step 3, upload a build and submit it for review, under the standing
constraint in step 2. The build side is covered by the CI workflow; the rest is
App Store Connect.

1. **App record.** *(Done.)* In App Store Connect, create a new app with the
   bundle id `org.geolibre.app` (register the app id in the Developer portal
   first). GeoLibre's record is Apple ID `6796039674`, listed under Productivity.
2. **Minimum Functionality (Guideline 4.2).** Apple rejects apps that are "a
   repackaged website." GeoLibre passes because it's a bundled native app with
   real device integration — GPS, offline-capable map workspace, local file
   handling — not a wrapper that loads a remote URL. Keep it that way: ship the
   web assets in the binary (the default here), don't point the webview at
   `geolibre.app`.
3. **Upload** the `.ipa` (via Transporter or Xcode Organizer) to a TestFlight
   build, then submit that build for App Store review. Take it from the
   `geolibre-ios-ipa` CI artifact, or — for an older tag whose artifact has
   expired — from that release's `GeoLibre_<version>_ios_app-store.ipa` asset.

   **Build numbers.** App Store Connect consumes a `CFBundleVersion`
   permanently per marketing version, and each upload must also sort above the
   last one consumed, so every upload needs a fresh, higher value. CI stamps the
   archive's `CFBundleVersion` with `$GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER` — an integer that only
   ever rises — while `CFBundleShortVersionString` keeps tracking
   `tauri.conf.json` and stays the version users see.

   Re-running an existing run appends `$GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT` (`42` becomes
   `42.2`), because the run number itself is fixed for a run's lifetime: without
   the suffix, re-running a run whose IPA was already uploaded would regenerate
   the same build number. The one hand-uploaded 2.4.0 build used `2.4.0`, which
   a bare run number of 3 or more already beats under Apple's dotted-integer
   comparison.

   This is deliberately **not** done with `tauri ios build --build-number`:
   that flag *appends* to the version, producing e.g. `2.4.0.42`. A
   `CFBundleVersion` may hold at most **three** period-separated integers, so
   App Store Connect rejects a four-component value at upload
   (`ITMS-90060`) — after the whole build has run. The verify step asserts the
   shape for that reason.

   Uploading by hand (no CI) means setting the build number yourself if the
   marketing version has been uploaded before.
4. **Store listing.** *(Done.)* Icon (already generated under
   `src-tauri/icons/ios`), screenshots for the required device sizes (6.7" and
   6.5" iPhone, plus 12.9" iPad — a GIS workspace is genuinely
   iPad-appropriate), description, keywords.
5. **Privacy.** *(Done.)* Fill the **App Privacy** questionnaire honestly —
   declare each network destination (geocoding, the AI assistant, basemap/tile
   fetches, Google OAuth for Earth Engine) and that location is used *when in
   use* and not collected by a backend. Point the privacy policy URL at the
   published [privacy policy](privacy.md).
6. **Age rating and category.** *(Done.)* GeoLibre is listed under
   **Productivity**.
7. **Export compliance.** *(Done.)* Already declared in
   `src-tauri/Info.ios.plist`:

   ```xml
   <key>ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption</key>
   <false/>
   ```

   App Store Connect asks about encryption on *every* upload, and a build with
   the question unanswered cannot be submitted or sent to testers ("Missing
   Compliance"). Declaring it in the plist answers it once, at build time.

   `false` asserts that GeoLibre's use of encryption stays limited to what Apple
   treats as exempt — HTTPS/TLS via the system libraries for tiles, geocoding,
   the AI assistant, cloud catalogs, and the collaboration relay — and that the
   app ships no cryptography of its own. That holds today, but it is a **legal
   declaration**, not a build flag: revisit it if that ever changes.

   Builds uploaded before this key was added (the first 2.4.0 upload) still
   need the question answered by hand in App Store Connect.

## Known limitations / follow-ups

Most mirror Android:

- Local-file sources (MBTiles, local rasters, project files) assume real
  filesystem paths; iOS hands apps sandboxed URLs via the document picker, so
  those flows need adapting before they work natively.
- The **Download Offline Area** tool relies on a service worker, which the Tauri
  builds don't use — it's a PWA feature. Native offline basemap caching is future
  work.
- Earth Engine OAuth uses a desktop loopback/multi-window flow; a mobile
  deep-link redirect (an iOS URL scheme / universal link) is future work.
- iPadOS multitasking (Split View / Stage Manager) hasn't been tuned; the
  responsive layout should adapt, but verify on a real iPad before release.
