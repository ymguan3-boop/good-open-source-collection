# Mapbox renderer

Choose **View → Rendering engine → Mapbox** to render a project with Mapbox GL JS.
The engine is also available from the rendering-engine menu in each split pane.
MapLibre remains the default. Projects save the primary and secondary renderer
choices, and the Python and iframe APIs accept `mapbox` as a renderer name.

Paste your token into **Settings → Environment Variables → Mapbox token** and
click **Save Settings**. Like the Cesium token, it is stored on this device,
outside the project file. Existing enabled Mapbox environment-variable rows
move into this field when settings are saved; Cancel leaves them unchanged.
Alternatively, launch the development server with `MAPBOX_TOKEN` in its environment. Token changes
recreate Mapbox maps. A missing token displays setup instructions; map loading
errors redact access tokens. Use a public Mapbox token appropriate for your
application. Mapbox use is associated with that token's account and is subject
to Mapbox's terms and usage pricing.

New projects use Mapbox Standard by default for the Mapbox renderer. Open the
shared **Basemaps** panel from the Layers panel or Add Data to select Mapbox
styles (including Streets), public styles, or stacked raster basemaps. The
separate floating Mapbox selector has been removed.

A style selected in the Basemaps panel is saved as
`preferences.map.mapboxStyleUrl` while Mapbox is active, leaving the shared
MapLibre/Cesium background unchanged. All Mapbox panes share that choice.
Previously saved projects keep their selected styles. Provider credentials
come from Environment variables or the basemap control's API keys panel.

## Supported paths

- Native GeoJSON, including the vector importer's materialized data, with point,
  line, polygon, extrusion, label, data-driven color, opacity, and filter styles.
- Remote vector PMTiles archives through Mapbox GL JS’s native archive reader.
- LiDAR (LAS/LAZ, COPC) and standard 3D Tiles through deck.gl overlays.
- Deck.gl Layers built in **Add Data → Deck.gl Layer** (every kind in the
  builder, including the 3D Model scenegraph kind behind **Add Data → 3D
  Model**), plus the 3D Z-value and feature-diagram rendering of ordinary
  vector layers, through the same shared interleaved deck.gl overlay.
- DuckDB query layers from **Add Data → DuckDB**, drawn by the panel's own
  deck.gl overlay.
- Zarr layers from **Add Data → Zarr Layer**, STAC Zarr assets, and NetCDF/HDF
  or Kerchunk cubes with a time axis, drawn by `@carbonplan/zarr-layer` — a
  `CustomLayerInterface` implementation that targets Mapbox GL as well as
  MapLibre (globe and Mercator), added by the same Zarr control. Zarr Layer
  and STAC adds keep the current projection; local NetCDF/HDF cubes and
  Kerchunk references draw untiled in Web Mercator, so adding one switches the
  map to Mercator, as on MapLibre. A remote NetCDF/HDF URL renders its
  selected slice as an image overlay instead.
- HTTP(S) raster tiles (XYZ, WMS and WMTS), vector tiles with named source layers,
  and georeferenced image/video sources.
- Shared layer/group visibility, opacity and ordering; synchronized or independent
  split-view cameras; Mercator/globe projection and Mapbox terrain.
- Feature picking, selection highlighting, extent drawing, draggable placement,
  and engine-level image capture.
- The same default on-map controls as MapLibre, governed by the same
  **Controls** menu: fullscreen, the reset pitch & bearing compass beneath it,
  a globe/Mercator toggle, the scale bar (following the project's scale unit)
  and attribution, with navigation and geolocate available but off by default.
  Mapbox GL JS has no globe control of its own, so the engine mounts a
  stand-in (`packages/map/src/mapbox-globe-control.ts`) that mirrors MapLibre's
  button markup; clicking it persists the projection into project preferences
  as on MapLibre. Terrain is a scene setting here (the Controls menu toggles
  Mapbox terrain directly, without a button, as on Cesium). The attribution
  control cannot be hidden, Mapbox draws its own logo, and the Maptoolkit logo
  is MapLibre-only.
- The on-map layer control (`maplibre-gl-layer-control`), with the same
  per-layer visibility, opacity, zoom-to and style-editor round trip to the
  store as on MapLibre. The control only needs the shared style API, so both 2D
  engines drive it through one host (`packages/map/src/layer-control-host.ts`);
  a `mapbox://` style cannot be fetched by the control, so the engine seeds it
  with the loaded style's own layers to tell basemap from project layers.
  Toggle and reposition it from **Plugins → Layer Control**, as on MapLibre.
  Split panes never mount a second control.

## Plugins

Plugins declare the renderers they support (`engines`); the Plugins menu and
command palette grey out the rest. `app.getMap()` stays MapLibre-only, so a
Mapbox-capable plugin reads the map through `getStyleMap(app)` (falls back to
`app.getMapboxMap()`) and stays on the Style Spec surface both engines share —
see [Supporting the Mapbox renderer](plugin-api.md#supporting-the-mapbox-renderer)
for the rules, the audit that enforces them, and how plugin-drawn layers are
adopted. The vector import panel uses the existing store-based geometry bridge.

Available on Mapbox (the September 2026 plugin audit, each verified in a
browser against an authenticated Mapbox map):

- **Layer Control**, **Basemaps**, **Deck.gl Layer** and **Components** (as
  before).
- **Web Services** — FEMA NFHL, NASA Earthdata (GIBS), US EPA EnviroAtlas,
  USGS National Map, USGS NLDI, Vantor, Planet Open Data, Earthdata GIS,
  OpenAerialMap, ArcGIS Hub, Socrata, CKAN, STAC Catalogs, Portolan, Source
  Cooperative, Natural Earth, Hugging Face, Esri Wayback, and GeoLens. The
  docked panels mount on the Mapbox map; the raster layers their controls
  create are adopted by the engine under the controls' own ids (one copy,
  store visibility/opacity/removal apply, rebuilt after a basemap swap).
  GeoLens _private_ rasters need a per-request API key that only MapLibre's
  `setTransformRequest` can inject; the panel reports that they need the
  MapLibre renderer, while public rasters and vector data work.
- **Gridlines** and the **DGGS** grids (H3, S2, A5, DGGRID, DGGAL, OLC,
  Geohash, Tilecode), including cell labels and click identification. Mapbox
  Standard's root style carries no symbol layer to borrow a font from, so
  labels use Mapbox's `Open Sans Regular` / `Arial Unicode MS Regular` glyphs.
- **Time Slider** for XYZ, WMS, GeoJSON and TiTiler-served COG sources. A COG
  bound to the `gpu` / `wasm` engines (MapLibre-only tile protocols) is
  re-added through TiTiler; a mosaic manifest is dropped with a console
  warning. The pixel time series tool picks and marks its points on Mapbox too
  (the engine's click events and projected DOM markers), and Identify reads a
  pixel's band values, as on MapLibre.
- **NetCDF** sample markers, the 3D cube's "current view" and "draw" extents,
  and the COG spectral-profile click work on either 2D engine.
- **Timelapse**, including recording the Mapbox canvas to video.
- **Elevation Profile**, **USGS LiDAR** (the 3DEP index raster is adopted
  natively; point clouds already drew through deck.gl), and **Mapillary**
  (coverage vector tiles are plugin-owned native layers mirrored from the
  store).
- **Elements** (annotations) and **Dimensions**. MapLibre's `Marker` cannot be
  added to a mapbox-gl map, so pins, sticky notes and image cards are placed by
  an engine-neutral marker (`annotation-marker.ts`): MapLibre's own marker on
  MapLibre, a DOM element repositioned through `project()` on Mapbox.
- **Route Animation** (marker, trail and arrow image through the shared style
  API; rebinds across a renderer swap). The panel's layer picker lists inline
  GeoJSON line layers on Mapbox; layers whose geometry only lives in a map
  source (Add Vector Layer's GeoJSON mode) need MapLibre's `getData()`.
- **Clouds** and **Precipitation** (store tile layers; the frame scrub goes
  through the store on Mapbox rather than the instant `setTiles` shortcut).
- **Geo Editor**, including Sketches, in-place geometry editing of a store
  layer and loading map-view features into the editor. Geoman keeps its engine
  calls behind one map adapter, and the three members that build MapLibre
  objects (the `Marker` behind vertex handles and the cursor marker, the
  `LngLatBounds` behind the cut tool's query box, and the promise-style
  `loadImage` for the default marker icon) are swapped for mapbox-gl's on the
  Mapbox map (`geo-editor-mapbox.ts`); the toolbar's rotate and
  feature-properties popups come from `maplibre-gl-geo-editor`'s `createPopup`
  option, fed mapbox-gl's `Popup`. Text markers use Mapbox's `Open Sans
  Regular` glyphs when the style has no font to borrow.
- **Atmospheric Effects** (its overlay canvases mount in the Mapbox canvas
  container; the control container is lifted above them, as on MapLibre) and
  **Sun** (canvas night mask, raster layer and `setLight` all apply to
  mapbox-gl).
- **Flight Simulator**. mapbox-gl kept the free camera MapLibre dropped, so the
  Mapbox adapter places the eye directly — a `MercatorCoordinate` carrying the
  altitude plus `setPitchBearing` — where MapLibre converts through
  `calculateCameraOptionsFromCameraLngLatAltRotation`. Terrain, the suspended
  interaction handlers, the widened pitch ceiling and the exit view all behave
  as on MapLibre; `setCenterClampedToGround` has no counterpart and needs none,
  because the free camera positions the eye rather than the map center. One
  setting does nothing here: mapbox-gl 3 has no camera roll axis at all (its
  free camera orientation is documented as representable with only pitch and
  bearing), so **Bank the horizon in turns** leaves the horizon level — the
  aircraft still banks, and a bank still turns it. The panel says so while the
  Mapbox renderer is primary.
- **Street View** (Google and Mapillary). Everything the upstream control
  touches is on the shared surface except the location marker: MapLibre's
  `Marker` reads `map._camera.transform` on every position update, so it threw
  on the first map click. `maplibre-gl-streetview` 0.8.0 takes a `createMarker`
  factory, and the plugin feeds it mapbox-gl's own `Marker` on a Mapbox host —
  the control still owns the marker element and its direction arrow, and only
  the positioning changes engine. A renderer swap rebuilds the control, so the
  marker follows whichever engine is primary.
- **Layer Swipe** for native style layers. The control drives both maps only
  through the surface the two engines share, so the one map it constructed
  itself — the clipped comparison pane, until now always a MapLibre one — comes
  from `maplibre-gl-swipe` 0.13.0's `createMap`, fed mapbox-gl's `Map`. Two Mapbox specifics come with it: the
  pane is handed the access token explicitly (mapbox-gl reads its token from a
  global the app never sets, so a second map built without it renders nothing),
  and the basemap grouping is seeded with `basemapLayerIds` because a
  `mapbox://` style URL cannot be fetched — the same reason the layer control
  seeds its own. The panel lists each row by the name the Layers panel shows
  rather than by the style layer id it drives, because the engine publishes the
  same style-layer-id-to-name bridge MapController does
  (`packages/map/src/layer-labels.ts`); without it a row read
  `geolibre-mapbox-<id>-geojson-fill`. The deck.gl **raster provider stays
  MapLibre-only**: COG and `maplibre-gl-raster` layers can draw on the primary
  Mapbox map through its deck.gl adapter, but the swipe provider cannot mirror
  them into the comparison pane. The swipe panel therefore omits those layers.
  One known defect: changing the basemap while the swipe is
  active leaves the previous comparison pane — and the map inside it, a live
  WebGL context — orphaned on the Mapbox canvas. The swipe itself keeps working
  against the new basemap. The same sequence on MapLibre leaves one pane, so it
  sits in the Mapbox control lifecycle rather than the plugin; tracked in #2430.
- **GeoAgent**. Almost every tool already sits on the shared Style Spec
  surface; four did not, and each broke differently — `add_marker` built
  MapLibre's `Marker`/`Popup`, `set_projection` wrote `{ type }` (Mapbox takes a
  name string), `get_map_state` read `projection.type`, and
  `run_maplibre_script` handed user-authored code the wrong namespace. That
  matters more here than in a control that simply fails to mount: an agent run
  breaks mid-way, after it has already changed the map. `maplibre-gl-geoagent`
  0.6.1 takes the engine as one option (`mapEngine`) and all four follow it, so
  the plugin names the host's engine once (`geoagent-map-engine.ts`) and hands
  over the whole mapbox-gl namespace — `run_maplibre_script` passes it straight
  to the script it runs. Agent overlays reach the Layers panel as
  plugin-owned rows the engine adopts, as on MapLibre. `set_sky` / `clear_sky`
  stay MapLibre-only: mapbox-gl has no `setSky` (it draws sky through a style
  layer), and the tool reports that instead of failing silently.
- **Overture Maps**. mapbox-gl 3.30+ reads `.pmtiles` archives itself, through
  a tile provider it fetches from `api.mapbox.com` (allowlisted in the desktop
  and web CSPs), so the plugin hands `maplibre-gl-overture-maps` its `nativePmtiles`
  option and the control adds plain https archive URLs instead of registering
  MapLibre's `pmtiles://` protocol; the inspection popup comes from the
  control's `createPopup` option, fed mapbox-gl's `Popup`. The Layers-panel
  mirrors are plugin-owned rows (the engine neither compiles nor repaints
  them), so release, visibility, opacity, color and export all work as on
  MapLibre. The Style panel's 3D extrusion of the buildings theme is a
  MapLibre layer-sync feature and stays MapLibre-only.

No plugin is held back by a MapLibre-internal dependency of its own. What
remains MapLibre-only is a map feature rather than a plugin.

Two engine changes came with the port and apply to every plugin: a store
layer added while a Mapbox source is still loading is now synced when that
source finishes (previously it waited for `idle`, which a map with an
animated canvas source never reaches), and the shared paint builders scale a
plugin-owned native layer's opacity by the store opacity instead of replacing
it.

The offline (local PMTiles) basemap is MapLibre-only as well: its `pmtiles://`
source protocol is not registered with Mapbox, so a Mapbox pane whose project
basemap is an offline archive falls back to the default basemap (with a console
warning). Pick a Mapbox style from the shared Basemaps panel instead.
MapLibre custom protocols, tiled/streamed vector imports beyond the bridge's
materialization limits, custom COG terrain, and other plugin-owned layers
require additional adapters. **Custom terrain sources** are one of those with
UI of its own: mapbox-gl has no `raster-dem` source a COG can back, so the
Terrain settings dialog's "Terrain source" section (a COG URL, a local file, or
a raster layer already on the map) is hidden on this renderer and explains why.
Mapbox's own global terrain and the vertical-exaggeration slider still work.

Layers drawn with deck.gl need none:
`@deck.gl/mapbox` targets Mapbox GL JS natively, so the engine reports
`capabilities.deckOverlay` and the shared interleaved overlay binds to the
Mapbox map through `app.getMapboxMap()`. Visible unsupported layers report an error
on the map instead of being silently omitted. The heatmap and clustered point
renderers compile to native Mapbox layers, with a clustered layer's authored
filters applied to its data before clustering, as on MapLibre.
The Style panel's symbology compiles to native Mapbox layers as on MapLibre:
marker and KML icons, Geo Editor text markers, fill patterns and line
decorations (generated sprites supplied through `styleimagemissing`), the
inverted fill and the geometry generator (companion GeoJSON sources), the flat
fill below a zoom-stepped extrusion, and attribute labels (de-duplicated labels
read an aggregated companion source; the data-defined size, color, opacity,
visibility and priority expressions apply). Layer blend modes are not
reproduced, and the Style panel says so on a layer that sets one. Large
GeoJSON (over 50,000 features) keeps mapbox-gl's own GeoJSON source: MapLibre
serves such layers as vector tiles through a geojson-vt protocol, and mapbox-gl
has no `addProtocol` hook, but its source already tiles the data in a worker
with geojson-vt. With 200,000 points, adding the layer took about 2.1 s on
Mapbox against 1.5 s on MapLibre, a restyle 0.9 s against 0.8 s, and a data
edit 2.1 s against 1.2 s, with a shorter longest main-thread stall on Mapbox
(0.8 s against 0.85 s). Mapbox Standard is loaded as a local style import with a shared opacity setting.
The Background card fades its land and water colors, labels (including ocean labels),
3D objects, and atmosphere while preserving project layers and Standard's configuration.

## License and terms

GeoLibre itself is MIT licensed, but the Mapbox renderer depends on
[Mapbox GL JS](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js) v3 (`mapbox-gl`
3.30.0 at the time of writing), which is **not** open source. Mapbox GL JS v3
is distributed under the
[Mapbox Terms of Service](https://www.mapbox.com/legal/tos) and its
[license](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/blob/main/LICENSE.txt);
it requires an active Mapbox account, may only be used with an access token
from that account and with the relevant Mapbox products, and its terms restrict
altering the SDK's billing, accounting and data-collection code. Usage-based
billing and Mapbox's attribution requirements depend on how the Mapbox services
are used under your account and the applicable terms; consult those terms before
enabling the renderer in a product. The SDK is a runtime dependency of
`@geolibre/map`, so npm consumers of that package and the desktop and web
distributions receive it even when MapLibre stays the active renderer, but no
Mapbox code runs (and no Mapbox service is contacted) until a Mapbox pane is
opened.

## Loading and size

Mapbox's JavaScript and CSS are imported only when a Mapbox pane mounts. The
production build gives them a separate chunk and excludes them from the PWA's
initial precache. MapLibre startup therefore does not download the Mapbox engine.
Desktop/web distribution artifacts still include it. With Mapbox GL JS 3.30.0,
the engine and stylesheet add approximately 1.91 MB raw, or 532 KB with gzip;
this excludes map tiles and other service responses.

## Add Data compatibility

The Add Data menu waits for Mapbox to finish loading before accepting an
import, so early clicks cannot lose a panel-opening request.

The Add Data menu and command palette withhold loaders that require an
unimplemented MapLibre protocol or custom render pass. These entries are
visible but disabled in the menu with a Mapbox compatibility hint: MBTiles
and Gaussian Splatting.
Cesium Ion and CZML scene loaders remain Cesium-only; KML / KMZ opens on every
renderer, going through the host KML importer (the drag-and-drop path) off the
globe.

Deck.gl Layer, 3D Model, and DuckDB are enabled: the first two render through
the shared interleaved deck.gl overlay (as 3D Tiles already did), the third
through the DuckDB panel's own deck.gl overlay. Like every deck.gl overlay they
hold the map in the Mercator projection while their layers are shown, so a
globe view snaps to Mercator when one is added. Deck.gl Layer data is stored
inline in the project, as on MapLibre. The DuckDB panel remounts on the live
map after a renderer swap; results that were only cached in the panel are
redrawn when it reopens, and a project-restored query layer needs its query
re-run, exactly as on MapLibre.

FlatGeobuf uses the shared vector importer on Mapbox. ArcGIS vector-tile
services retain their resolved tile sources, service styles, classification
filters, visibility, and opacity. STAC supports catalog browsing, extent
search, bbox drawing, footprints, and selection on both MapLibre and Mapbox;
remote vector PMTiles and Zarr assets can be added on either.

NetCDF/HDF files and directly readable remote files render a selected plane as
an image on both engines; cubes with a time axis, and Kerchunk references, go
through the Zarr renderer on Mapbox exactly as on MapLibre.

### Browser validation

The September 2026 audit opened every one of the 37 Add Data entries that was
enabled, checked the existing disabled entries, and exercised the public data
paths below with an authenticated Mapbox map. A mounted panel alone is not a
successful import; the table records the level of verification. Backend and
service restrictions are included explicitly.

An opt-in regression suite repeats the FlatGeobuf, ArcGIS vector-tile, STAC,
and menu-boundary checks in light and dark themes:

```bash
# Supply a public token in the environment before running.
npm exec -- playwright test e2e/mapbox-add-data.spec.ts
```

The tests skip when `MAPBOX_TOKEN` is absent. They use live public services;
remote-service availability is part of these integration checks.

### PMTiles and 3D adapters

The PMTiles panel keeps its archive discovery and source-layer selection UI, but
Mapbox imports go through the layer store. Each selected source layer has an
independent Mapbox source and editable style. This path supports remote HTTP(S)
**vector** archives whose URL path ends in `.pmtiles`; raster archives, local files,
and the offline PMTiles basemap remain unsupported and receive a load error.

LiDAR uses the existing point-cloud loader and its separate deck.gl canvas.
Standard 3D Tiles use the shared interleaved overlay, retaining the same project
source records as MapLibre. Both require Mercator. Tileset altitude offsets move
the geometry and traversal bounds together, so lowered tiles remain visible when
zooming in or reopening a saved project. The 3D Tiles panel reports loading and
fetch errors; visibility, opacity and removal follow the layer store.

The opt-in `e2e/mapbox-archives-3d.spec.ts` uses public PMTiles, COPC and AGI tileset
URLs and checks save/reopen in light and dark themes. Set `MAPBOX_TOKEN` at runtime,
then run it with `npx playwright test e2e/mapbox-archives-3d.spec.ts`.
Google Photorealistic and authenticated I3S services require their own credentials;
those services and every 3D Tiles extension are not covered by this test.
