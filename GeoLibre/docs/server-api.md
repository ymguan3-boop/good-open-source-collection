# GeoLibre projects and identity API

This document defines version 1 of the HTTP contract used by GeoLibre's
Project Gallery and **Project → Share** flow. A compatible server may use any
implementation or storage engine. The reference implementation lives in
`backend/geolibre_server_api`.

## Conventions

- The base URL is configured with `GEOLIBRE_SHARE_URL` at container runtime
  (or `VITE_GEOLIBRE_SHARE_URL` at build time).
- JSON request and response bodies use `application/json` and camel-case keys.
- Dates are UTC ISO 8601 strings.
- Authenticated endpoints accept a personal API token or OAuth access token in
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Error responses are JSON objects with an `error` string. `401` means a
  missing, invalid, or expired token; `403` means the authenticated principal
  lacks permission; `404` deliberately covers both a missing project and a
  project the caller may not discover; `409` is a uniqueness conflict; `422`
  is malformed input; and `429` is rate limiting.
- Servers should send `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600` on immutable raw
  project versions and may use `ETag`/conditional requests. Private responses
  must use `Cache-Control: private, no-store`.
- CORS deployments must allow `Authorization` and `Content-Type` from the
  GeoLibre web origin. Native desktop requests do not depend on CORS.

## What the reference server leaves to the operator

Deployment protections remain the operator's responsibility:

- **Personal-token lifecycle.** Omitting `expiresInDays` preserves the v1
  delete-only lifecycle and creates a non-expiring token. Require an explicit
  1–365 day lifetime where bounded credentials are needed, and revoke or rotate
  delete-only and legacy tokens operationally.
- **Rate limiting.** The OAuth consent flow caps pending interactions per
  browser binding, but a fresh cookie bypasses that cap; the reference server
  has no general request limiter. Before enabling OAuth publicly, enforce
  per-client-IP limits at the ingress on **GET and POST** `/oauth/authorize`,
  `POST /oauth/token`, `POST /api/auth/token`, and `POST /api/accounts`.
  The last three POSTs include password or token operations; consent login
  and the PAT/account routes run scrypt. Add per-username limits where the
  ingress can safely parse credentials. Every public path to the API must go
  through this limiter: Compose binds the API host port to loopback by default.
  A root-issuer nginx deployment can put this zone in its `http` context and
  the location in its TLS issuer `server` context:

  ```nginx
  # http context
  limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=geolibre_auth:10m rate=12r/m;

  # TLS issuer server context; proxy other API routes separately.
  location ~ ^/(oauth/(authorize|token)|api/(auth/token|accounts))$ {
      limit_req zone=geolibre_auth burst=6 nodelay;
      limit_req_status 429;
      client_max_body_size 16k;
      access_log off;
      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
      proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
  }
  ```

  Preserve the original Host authority, including any port, or OAuth host
  binding rejects the request. Route the issuer's exact discovery URL and
  other API paths to the same backend; for a path-prefixed issuer, apply the
  limit to its externally visible prefix and strip that prefix when proxying.
  Suppress authorization request query strings, callback `Location` headers,
  and callback request query strings at the web ingress in proxy, WAF, and
  load-balancer logs.
- **A request-size limit.** The server rejects an oversized *declared*
  `Content-Length` before reading the body, but a chunked or HTTP/2 request
  declares no length and is parsed in full before the per-route limit applies.
  Cap request size at the proxy as well.

The reference implementation is a correctness baseline, not a hardened
deployment.

## Limits

| Field | Limit |
| --- | ---: |
| project title (derived from the uploaded project) | 100 Unicode code points |
| username | 3–39 lowercase ASCII letters, digits, or hyphens |
| slug | 1–100 lowercase ASCII letters, digits, or hyphens |
| description | 2,000 Unicode code points |
| tags | 20 tags, 40 Unicode code points each |
| project document | 50 MiB UTF-8 JSON |
| thumbnail | 5 MiB; PNG, JPEG, or WebP |
| `limit` | default 24, maximum 100 |

Servers may configure a smaller upload limit, but must return `413` and an
`error` explaining that limit.

## Visibility

- `public`: discoverable in the public listing and readable without auth.
- `unlisted`: omitted from public listings, but readable by anyone holding its
  URL. It appears in the owner's authenticated listing.
- `private`: readable and mutable only by its owner. Raw and thumbnail URLs
  require the same Bearer token as the metadata endpoint.

Changing visibility affects every version immediately. A raw URL is therefore
not a capability URL for a private project.

## Identity

### `POST /api/accounts`

Creates an account and returns a personal API token once. This endpoint may be
disabled when an installation delegates identity to an external provider.
`name`, `scopes`, and `expiresInDays` are optional. New tokens default to all
three project scopes. Omitting `expiresInDays` preserves the v1 delete-only
token lifecycle (the token does not expire); the accepted explicit lifetime is
1–365 days. An unknown or empty `scopes` list returns `400`
`{"error": "invalid_scope"}`; an `expiresInDays` outside 1–365 returns `400`
`{"error": "invalid_request"}`.

```json
{
  "username": "ada",
  "password": "correct horse battery staple",
  "name": "GeoLibre desktop",
  "scopes": ["read:projects", "write:projects"],
  "expiresInDays": 30
}
```

Response `201`:

```json
{
  "account": {"id": "uuid", "username": "ada", "createdAt": "2026-08-03T12:00:00Z"},
  "token": "secret-token",
  "tokenId": "uuid",
  "scopes": ["read:projects", "write:projects"],
  "expiresAt": "2026-09-02T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### `POST /api/auth/token`

Exchanges account credentials for a personal API token. It accepts the same
optional policy fields and returns the same shape as account creation. Tokens
are opaque and stored only as SHA-256 digests.

### `DELETE /api/auth/token`

Revokes the presented Bearer token. Response: `204`.

### `GET /api/users/me`

Returns the account, effective project scopes, and OAuth session ID. `sessionId`
is `null` for personal tokens.

```json
{
  "user": {"id": "uuid", "username": "ada", "createdAt": "2026-08-03T12:00:00Z"},
  "sessionId": "oauth-session-uuid",
  "scopes": ["read:projects", "write:projects", "share:public"]
}
```

An identity provider may create accounts without a username. Project creation
for such an account must return `400` with an error containing the stable,
case-insensitive sentinel text `username required`. Existing clients recognize
that phrase and direct the user to account settings.

## Projects

### Project representation

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "username": "ada",
  "slug": "wetlands",
  "title": "Wetlands",
  "description": "",
  "visibility": "public",
  "thumbnailUrl": "/api/projects/uuid/thumbnail",
  "views": 12,
  "forkCount": 0,
  "versionCount": 1,
  "featured": false,
  "createdAt": "2026-08-03T12:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-08-03T12:00:00Z",
  "tags": [],
  "rawJsonUrl": "https://example.org/ada/wetlands.geolibre.json",
  "projectUrl": "https://example.org/ada/wetlands",
  "viewerUrl": "https://example.org/?project=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2Fada%2Fwetlands.geolibre.json"
}
```

URLs are absolute except that `thumbnailUrl` may be root-relative. Consumers
must resolve a relative thumbnail URL against the server base URL. Unknown
fields must be ignored.

### `POST /api/projects`

Requires auth. Creates a project and its first immutable version.

```json
{
  "filename": "Wetlands.geolibre.json",
  "content": "{\"version\":\"1.0\", ...}",
  "visibility": "public"
}
```

`content` is a string containing a valid GeoLibre project JSON document.
`filename` supplies a fallback title/slug; the project document's non-empty
title is authoritative. `visibility` is required and is `public`, `unlisted`,
or `private`.

Response `201`:

```json
{"project": {"id": "uuid", "username": "ada", "slug": "wetlands", "projectUrl": "...", "viewerUrl": "...", "rawJsonUrl": "..."}}
```

The `project` object is the full project representation. In particular,
`projectUrl` and `rawJsonUrl` are required because the current client treats a
successful response without them as invalid.

### `GET /api/projects`

Returns a page in newest-updated-first order:

```json
{"projects": [], "limit": 24, "offset": 0, "total": 0}
```

Query parameters:

- `limit`: integer page size.
- `offset`: non-negative number of matching records to skip.
- `featured=true`: return featured projects only.
- `mine=true`: return the caller's own projects, including unlisted and private
  ones. Requires auth; without a valid token this is `401`.

Only public projects are returned unless `mine=true` is set. An Authorization
header does not broaden a public listing by itself. Invalid pagination is `422`.

### `GET /api/users/{username}/projects`

Returns `{"projects": [...]}` owned by `{username}`, in newest-updated-first
order. Auth is optional and decides the breadth of the result: when the token
identifies `{username}`, the listing includes their unlisted and private
projects; every other caller, authenticated or not, sees only that user's public
projects. The current client first resolves its username through
`GET /api/users/me`, then calls this route.

A non-owner therefore gets a filtered `200`, not a `403` — the listing narrows
rather than refusing, which keeps a user's existence from being probed through
the status code.

### `GET /api/projects/{id}`

Returns `{"project": <project>}` if visible to the caller.

### `PATCH /api/projects/{id}`

Requires ownership. Accepted fields are `title`, `description`, `visibility`,
and `tags`. Response: `{"project": <project>}`.

### `PUT /api/projects/{id}/content`

Requires ownership. Creates a new immutable version.

```json
{"content": "{\"version\":\"1.0\", ...}"}
```

Response `201`: `{"project": <project>, "version": <positive integer>}`.

### `DELETE /api/projects/{id}`

Requires ownership. Deletes metadata and stored objects. Response: `204`.

### `GET /api/projects/{id}/activity`

Requires ownership. Returns the project's activity log, newest first, capped
at 100 entries:

```json
{"activity": [
  {"id": "…", "action": "visibility_change", "actorId": "…",
   "details": {"before": "private", "after": "public"}, "createdAt": "…"},
  {"id": "…", "action": "open", "actorId": null,
   "details": {"date": "2026-08-21", "count": 40}, "createdAt": "…"}
]}
```

Actions and their `details`: `version_save` (`version`), `fork`
(`forked_project_id`), `visibility_change` (`before`, `after`), `fetch` of
the raw JSON (`version`) and `open` of the project page. `actorId` is the
acting account, or `null` for an anonymous visitor. Anonymous `open` and
`fetch` events are **never stored per visitor**: they are aggregated into one
row per action and UTC day carrying a `count`, and no IP address or other
visitor fingerprint is recorded. Rows are pruned after
`GEOLIBRE_ACTIVITY_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 90) the next time the project logs
an event. The log is visible only to the owner and never appears in listings.

### `DELETE /api/projects/{id}/activity`

Requires ownership. Deletes every activity row for the project. Response: `204`.

### `POST /api/projects/{id}/forks`

Requires auth. Creates a new project owned by the caller from the visible
source's latest content. The request body is **optional**: `{"visibility": ...}`
selects the fork's visibility, and omitting the body entirely (the common "fork
this project" call) must behave as `{"visibility":"private"}` rather than
returning `422`. Responds `201` with `{"project": <project>}`. The source
`forkCount` increases atomically.

### Raw project and website-compatible routes

- `GET /{username}/{slug}.geolibre.json` returns the latest project document
  with `Content-Type: application/json`.
- `GET /api/projects/{id}/versions/{version}` returns an immutable historical
  document.
- `GET /{username}/{slug}` may return an HTML project page or redirect to the
  configured GeoLibre viewer. It is the `projectUrl` advertised by the API.

Every successful read of the latest raw document may increment `views`; servers
must not count failed or unauthorized reads.

### Thumbnails

`PUT /api/projects/{id}/thumbnail` requires ownership and accepts the image
bytes with their image content type. `GET /api/projects/{id}/thumbnail` follows
project visibility. `DELETE` removes it. Upload and delete responses are `204`.

## Personal token scopes

| Scope | Grants |
| --- | --- |
| `read:projects` | List and open the caller's own projects, including unlisted/private projects |
| `write:projects` | Create, update, delete, and fork projects owned by the caller |
| `share:public` | Create a public project or raise a project's visibility to public |

New personal tokens require a nonempty subset of these scopes. Omitting
`scopes` preserves the historical project permissions for existing clients.
Omitting `expiresInDays` keeps the token valid until revoked (the v1
delete-only lifecycle); set `expiresInDays` to 1–365 to mint an expiring token.
Tokens that predate the policy table are upgraded on first use with all three
project scopes, no expiry, and a legacy marker.

A valid credential missing a required scope receives `403` with
`{"error": "insufficient_scope", "requiredScope": "<scope>"}` and
`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="insufficient_scope"`. Missing credentials use
the `Bearer` challenge; malformed, unknown, revoked, and expired credentials use
`Bearer error="invalid_token"`.

## OAuth 2.0 sign-in (Authorization Code + S256 PKCE)

The reference server implements Authorization Code with PKCE (`S256` only) for
public clients; no client secret is accepted. Registrations are exact and
startup-validated through `GEOLIBRE_OAUTH_CLIENTS`. The only supported client
IDs are `geolibre-web` and `geolibre-desktop`. Empty or unset configuration
disables every OAuth route without changing personal-token startup behavior.

The issuer is `GEOLIBRE_PUBLIC_URL`. When OAuth is enabled it must be an
absolute HTTPS URL. Loopback HTTP is allowed only for `localhost` or
`127.0.0.1` with an explicit port. The request `Host` header, including its
port, must match the issuer authority.

### Discovery

`GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` returns RFC 8414 metadata. For an
issuer with path `/services/projects`, the route is
`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/services/projects`. The document
advertises the authorization, token, and revocation endpoints; authorization
code and refresh grants; `S256`; and the three project scopes.

### Authorization and consent

`GET /oauth/authorize` accepts one value each for `response_type=code`,
`client_id`, exact `redirect_uri`, nonempty `scope`, `state`, `code_challenge`,
and `code_challenge_method=S256`; `device_label` is optional. State is 16–512
URL-safe characters. The S256 challenge is the 43-character unpadded base64url
SHA-256 value.

Duplicate authorization parameters, unknown clients, unregistered redirects,
and state values longer than 512 characters return a local error page without
a `Location` header. Other authorization errors redirect to the already
validated callback with `error`, `iss`, and the exact `state` value when supplied.

`POST /oauth/authorize` submits the server-owned consent form. It requires the
browser-binding cookie, CSRF value, same-origin `Origin` or `Referer`, and
account credentials. Approval returns `303` to the exact callback with a
single-use code, `state`, and `iss`; cancellation returns `access_denied`.
Authorization codes expire after 60 seconds by default.

Web redirects must be absolute HTTPS URLs ending in `/oauth-callback.html`.
Explicit-port loopback HTTP is allowed for development. Desktop redirects must
be exactly `org.geolibre.desktop:/oauth/callback`.

### Token exchange and rotation

`POST /oauth/token` accepts form-urlencoded bodies up to 16 KiB:

- `grant_type=authorization_code` requires `client_id`, `code`,
  `redirect_uri`, and a 43–128 character `code_verifier`.
- `grant_type=refresh_token` requires `client_id` and `refresh_token`.
  Optional `scope` must be the same scope set as the original grant; ordering
  does not matter.

Success returns:

```json
{
  "access_token": "opaque",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 600,
  "refresh_token": "opaque",
  "scope": "read:projects write:projects"
}
```

Access tokens expire after 600 seconds by default and never outlive their
family. Refresh tokens are single-use and rotate on every use. Reusing a
consumed refresh token revokes the entire family, including tokens minted by
the successful rotation. A family expires at issuance plus the configured
refresh TTL (30 days by default); rotation never extends it.

An enabled server deletes bounded batches of expired interactions, access
tokens, and families at startup, during OAuth requests, and every five minutes
while running. Consumed refresh generations stay until the family expires so
replay detection remains effective.

`POST /oauth/revoke` accepts `client_id`, `token`, and optional advisory
`token_type_hint`. A matching access or refresh token revokes its entire
family. Unknown, already-revoked, and wrong-client tokens all return the same
empty `200`.

OAuth failures use `invalid_request`, `invalid_client`, `invalid_grant`,
`invalid_scope`, `unsupported_grant_type`, or `unsupported_token_type`. Token
and revocation responses are `no-store`. Raw codes and tokens are returned once;
the database stores only SHA-256 digests.

OAuth access tokens use the same project scope matrix as personal tokens.
`admin:org` and `manage:sessions` are reserved for later stacks and are rejected
by this server.

## Compatibility

The API is additive within version 1. Implementations must not repurpose fields
or narrow visibility rules. New optional fields and endpoints may be added.
Breaking changes require a new `/api/v2` namespace. The conformance baseline is
the frontend tests for `share-geolibre.ts` and `share-gallery.ts`, plus the
reference server's API tests.
