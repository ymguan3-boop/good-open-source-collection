 * The renderer-neutral surface the app drives a map through (issue #2260).
 *
 * Historically there was no such seam: every panel, menu, and plugin reached
 * the map through `MapController`, a MapLibre-specific class, so the 3D globe
 * — which has no `MapController` — left ~681 call sites pointing at `null` and
 * the UI compensated with hardcoded `primaryRenderer === "cesium"` gates. This
 * interface is the extraction of that surface, so a second engine can satisfy
 * it and those gates can key off {@link MapEngineCapabilities} instead of the
 * engine's name.
 *
 * `init()` is deliberately absent: it constructs the underlying map and returns
 * an engine-specific handle, and only each engine's own canvas component calls
 * it (`MapCanvas`/`SecondaryMapCanvas` for MapLibre). Construction is where the
 * engines legitimately differ; everything after it is what this interface
 * covers.
 *
 * Members that only one engine can honor are still declared here rather than
 * being split into a second interface. Two reasons: the call sites already
 * handle the "no map yet" case (a `MapController` returns `null`/`false` before
 * `init` and after `destroy`), so an engine that never supports an operation is
 * shaped like a map that is not ready yet; and splitting would push a
 * discriminated union onto all ~681 call sites for no gain. Which members are
 * meaningful is instead declared by {@link capabilities} — read that, do not
 * branch on {@link kind}.
