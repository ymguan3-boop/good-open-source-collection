 * `layer-<uuid>-fill` on MapLibre and `geolibre-mapbox-<uuid>-geojson-fill` on
 * Mapbox. The app rewrites those rows from this map
 * (`apps/geolibre-desktop/src/lib/swipe-style.ts`), so what the panel shows
 * matches the Layers panel.
 *
 * A window global rather than an option because the control has no hook for it
