/**
 * Imperative registry for plugin-owned dockable side panels.
 *
 * Mirrors the open/subscribe panel pattern used elsewhere in this package
 * (see `maplibre-components.ts`): the registry is module-level state, plugins
 * mutate it through the host API (`registerRightPanel`, `openRightPanel`, ...),
 * and the desktop shell subscribes with `useSyncExternalStore` to mount the
 * active panel in one of three dock positions. Keeping the registry in
 * `@geolibre/plugins` (rather than the app) lets the host API delegate to it
 * without the app and the plugins package depending on each other.
 *
 * Only one plugin panel is active at a time. It docks at one of four positions
 * and the user can step it between them. The built-in panel on the side the
 * panel is docked (Layers on the left, Style on the right) collapses to its
 * rail while the panel is expanded there; the shell handles that. Two further
 * docks, `replace-style` and `replace-layers`, are non-positional shared-rail
 * modes in which the panel shares the Style (right) or Layers (left) sidebar's
 * single rail rather than sitting beside it; they are not part of the steppable
 * position order.
