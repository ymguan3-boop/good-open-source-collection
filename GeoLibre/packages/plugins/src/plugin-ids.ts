// Plugin ids kept apart from the plugin implementations that use them.
//
// `VIEWER_BLOCKED_PLUGIN_IDS` has to name plugins without pulling their code
// in: `maplibre-geoagent.ts` imports `maplibre-gl-earth-engine`, which touches
// `window` at module load, so importing the plugin module just to read a string
// would make the blocklist — and every test of it — browser-only. Each plugin
// module imports its id from here and re-exports it, so the id a plugin
// registers under and the id the viewer guard blocks are the same binding and
// cannot drift.
