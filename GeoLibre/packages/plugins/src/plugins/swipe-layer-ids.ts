/**
 * Resolving the project layer ids a saved swipe carries into the MapLibre style
 * layer ids the swipe control actually drives.
 *
 * `SwipeControl` splits the map by toggling **style layer** visibility, and
 * matches its `leftLayers`/`rightLayers` against `getStyle().layers` by exact
 * id. A project (`.geolibre.json`) instead names layers by their **store** id —
 * that is what the Python `authoring.add_swipe` and the MCP `add_swipe` tool
 * write, and it is all they can write: a GeoJSON layer draws through several
 * style layers, and vector-tile/MBTiles/PMTiles ids embed source-layer names
 * that only the running app knows. A side holding an id the control cannot
 * match assigns the layer to neither half, so it stays drawn across the whole
 * map — the bug in #2161, of which #2155 fixed the single-style-layer raster
 * case in Python.
 *
 * The app is the one place that can close the gap, because it can read the live
 * style. These helpers expand each project id into the style layer ids that
 * currently draw it, keeping the project id in the list so the saved file stays
 * portable and re-resolves on the next load.

 * - the {@link nativeLayerIdPrefix} shared by every id `syncLayers` derives;

 *   named outside the prefix scheme;
 * - {@link pmtilesStyleLayerIds}, for the one scheme none of the above reaches;
 * - {@link mapboxSourceId}, because the Mapbox engine compiles the same store
 *   layer under a scheme of its own (`geolibre-mapbox-<id>` as the source, and
 *   `geolibre-mapbox-<id>-<sourceLayer>-<kind>` as the style layers). Both are
