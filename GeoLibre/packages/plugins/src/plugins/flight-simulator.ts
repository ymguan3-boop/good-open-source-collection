/**
 * Flight Simulator plugin — an interactive, keyboard-driven free-flight camera
 * over GeoLibre's terrain and 3D layers (issue #1454).
 *
 * Every other camera path in the app is scripted and discrete: `flyTo` from Set
 * View, story-map chapters, the keyframe Camera Tour recorder. This one is
 * continuous — an aircraft state is integrated each animation frame and the
 * MapLibre camera is placed to match, so the user steers rather than declares a
 * destination.
 *
 * **How the camera is driven.** Each renderer places the camera its own way.
 * MapLibre has no `setFreeCameraOptions` (that is a Mapbox API added after the
 * fork); its equivalent is
 * `map.calculateCameraOptionsFromCameraLngLatAltRotation()`, which converts a
 * camera position in lng/lat/altitude plus an orientation into the
 * `CameraOptions` that `jumpTo` accepts. Mapbox uses the free camera it kept:
 * a `MercatorCoordinate` carrying the altitude plus a pitch/bearing pair.
 * Cesium's camera is already free. The flight model lives in
 * `flight-simulator-physics.ts` so it can be unit-tested without a map.
 *
 * **Why the camera pitch saturates.** That conversion finds the ground point the
 * camera looks at by dividing by `cos(pitch)`, so a pitch of exactly 90° (dead
 * level with the horizon) puts the map center — and the derived zoom — at
 * infinity. The camera is therefore capped at {@link MAX_CAMERA_PITCH}, just
 * short of it. Level flight looks slightly downward, which is also what keeps
 * terrain rather than empty sky filling the viewport.
