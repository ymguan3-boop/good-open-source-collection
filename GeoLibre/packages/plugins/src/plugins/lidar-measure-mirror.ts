/**
 * Draws the Measure tool's geometry above a LiDAR point cloud.
 *
 * `maplibre-gl-lidar` renders point clouds into its own *overlaid* deck.gl
 * canvas, which sits above MapLibre's. The Measure tool draws into MapLibre's
 * canvas, so wherever the cloud has points the measured line or polygon is
 * hidden (issue #2533 — #2532 fixed the same occlusion for the control panels
 * and the tool's DOM vertex handles, which are ordinary DOM). Two canvases
 * cannot interleave, and moving the point cloud *into* MapLibre's canvas does
 * not help either: MapLibre draws translucent 2D layers with a per-layer depth
 * range pinned near the far plane while deck writes the points' real depths,
 * so the line loses the depth test wherever there are points, whatever the
 * layer order.
 *
 * What does work is drawing the geometry into the point cloud's *own* deck
 * overlay with `depthTest: false` — exactly how the plugin's own cross-section
 * line manages to sit above the points. The MapLibre measure layers are left
 * alone: outside the cloud both copies draw the same geometry in the same
 * colour, and inside it the deck copy is the one that shows. If anything here
 * fails to find what it needs, the tool simply keeps its pre-#2533 behaviour.
