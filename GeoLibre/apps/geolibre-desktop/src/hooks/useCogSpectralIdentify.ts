/**
 * Charts a clicked pixel's values across every band of a multiband COG
 * (issue #1818).
 *
 * The COG Identify path already reports the clicked pixel's band values in a
 * popup (see `useRasterIdentify`, which drives the raster control's inspector).
 * What it could not do is show the *shape* of that response across bands, which
 * is the operation introductory remote sensing turns on: click water, click
 * vegetation, click asphalt, compare the three curves.
 *
 * Everything downstream is reused rather than rebuilt — the profile store, the
 * chart, the numbered map markers, the floating window, the PNG/CSV export are
 * all shared with the NetCDF cube path, because the reader returns the same
 * shape. This hook is only the bridge from a map click to that store.
 *
 * Mounted once at the app shell, alongside the other identify hooks.
