/**
 * What the live map engine can do, for UI that needs to gate on it (issue #2260).
 *
 * Menus and panels used to ask `primaryRenderer === "cesium"` and disable
 * accordingly. That got it wrong in both directions: it hid camera work,
 * terrain, and framing that the globe does natively, and it would stop
 * describing reality the moment a third engine appeared. This is the one place
 * the question is asked, so every consumer gates on a capability instead.
 *
 * Reading `ref.current` is not reactive on its own, which is why the store's
 * `primaryRenderer` is subscribed to: swapping engines is exactly when
 * capabilities change, and between swaps they are constant. The renderer is
 * also the fallback for the window before a canvas has published its engine —
 * the only place the engine's *name* is still consulted, and it answers with
 * that engine's own frozen capability object rather than a hand-written guess.
 *
 * The ref is optional because some menus never receive it. They get the same
 * answer through the fallback, which is why this hook — not each call site — is
 * where the renderer-to-capability mapping lives.
