// The app side of the desktop Jupyter map-command relay. This is the SIBLING of

// notebook iframe the app embeds, which only works while the notebook is
// rendered inside the Notebook panel. This one subscribes to a loopback
// WebSocket on the Jupyter server itself, so a kernel driven by ANY frontend —
// notably VS Code's Jupyter extension attached to the same server — reaches the
// same map (issue #1442).
//
// Both feed the SAME createScriptingHandlers surface used by the in-app Python
// console and the Jupyter widget, so behaviour cannot drift between transports.

 * until a server has been started.
