 * actually change.
 *
 * Args:
 *     mapControllerRef: Ref to the live map engine.
 *     mapReadyGeneration: Counter that increments when the map (re)initialises,
 *         used to (re)attach the `moveend` listener once a map exists.
 *     projectGeneration: Counter that increments when a different project is
 *         loaded; the stack is cleared so "Previous View" can't jump back into
 *         the previous project's extents.
