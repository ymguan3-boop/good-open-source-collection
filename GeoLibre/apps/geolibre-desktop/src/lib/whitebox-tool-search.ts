/**
 * Substring search over the Whitebox tool catalog.
 *
 * Two places search those ~1,000 tools by text — the Whitebox toolbox dialog's
 * filter box and the assistant's `list_whitebox_tools` — and both want the same
 * rule, so it lives here once.
 *
 * The rule has two halves. **Match names and summaries, but never let a summary
 * match outrank a name match**, and **within the name matches, put the tool
 * actually called that first.**
 *
 * The first half is what lets "speckle" find the four SAR filters, none of
 * which say so in their name — before the catalog carried summaries that search
 * returned nothing at all. But a summary is a paragraph, so a common word hits
 * dozens of tools: matching name and summary in one joined string leaves the
 * results in catalog order with nothing to separate the tool called Slope from
 * the forty that mention slope in passing. Measured against the shipped
 * catalog, that put the Slope tool 47th of 51 hits for "slope", and 15th of 18
 * for "watershed".
 *
 * The second half is what the first does not fix. Splitting names from
 * summaries restored Slope to 20th of 21 — the rank it held before the catalog
 * carried summaries at all — which is still buried behind every tool whose name
 * merely contains the word (Average Flowpath Slope, Downslope Index, …). So the
 * name matches are themselves tiered: a tool whose id or label *is* the query
 * leads, then the ones it is a prefix of, then the rest in catalog order.
 * Searching "slope", "watershed" or "aspect" now reaches the tool of that name
 * first instead of 20th, 12th and 2nd.
 *
 * Ranking reads {@link WhiteboxToolText.identifiers} — the tool's own id and
 * label — rather than the joined text the substring pass uses, so a category
 * name cannot promote its whole category ("terrain" would otherwise rank the 36
 * tools filed under Terrain ahead of the tools named after it). Identifiers are
 * compared with `_` and `-` folded to spaces, so `fill_depressions`,
 * `fill-depressions` and `Fill Depressions` are one query.
