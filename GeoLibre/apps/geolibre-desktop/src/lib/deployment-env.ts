// Reads the deployment env the Docker entrypoint injects at container startup.
//
// `docker/entrypoint.sh` rewrites `geolibre-runtime-config.js` on every boot,
// setting `window.__GEOLIBRE_DEPLOYMENT_ENV__` to a JSON object of
// `VITE_*`-keyed values. `index.html` pulls that script in before the bundle, so
// the values are on `window` by the time any module reads them. This is how an
// operator repoints a *prebuilt* image with `-e GEOLIBRE_…=…` instead of
// rebuilding it.
//
// One exception to the `VITE_*` rule: the entrypoint also writes the bare
// `GEOLIBRE_NASA_OPERA_NEWS_PROXY_ENDPOINT`, whose reader is a plugin loaded from
// outside this repo and so is not bound by our naming. It is published alongside
// the `VITE_*` aliases this module reads, not instead of them, so nothing here
// needs to handle it.
//
// Precedence for anything configurable both ways is deployment env first, then
// the build-time Vite env — the deployment is the more specific statement, and
// the published image is built with the defaults. `readDeploymentAssistantEnv`
// and `readEmbedOrigins` established that order; this module is the shared
// implementation for the settings that are a single URL.
