 * Build a `GeoLibreProject` snapshot from the live store and map controller.

 * live-collaboration adapter (WebSocket), so both broadcast byte-identical
 * project state. It mirrors the Save/Share path: the camera is read from the
 * controller (so pan/zoom round-trips), falling back to the store before the map
 * is ready, and plugin state is merged in from the plugin manager.
 *
 * @param mapControllerRef - Ref to the live map controller; its `readView()`
 *   supplies the current camera.
 * @param overrides - Replacements for store fields the caller has already
 *   transformed. Routing every caller through this one field list keeps a new
 *   project field from reaching one snapshot path but not another.
 * @returns The serializable project snapshot.
