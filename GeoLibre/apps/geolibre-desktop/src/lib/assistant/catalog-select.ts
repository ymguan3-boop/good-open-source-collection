/**
 * Semantic selection over the Whitebox tool catalog.
 *
 * `list_whitebox_tools` has always answered with a substring filter over tool
 * names, ids and categories. That works when the model already knows the word
 * the catalog uses, and not at all otherwise: measured over 20 raster requests,
 * a filter given the request in the user's own words ("get rid of the grainy
 * speckle in a radar image") matched **nothing** on all 20, because no tool is
 * named "grainy". Given instead the single best keyword a model could guess, it
 * put the right tool somewhere in its 25 results 19 times — but first only 8
 * times, so the model still had to read a list and choose.
 *
 * This module asks Jev instead. 775 tools do not fit in one Choice question
 * (the API caps at 255 options), so the lookup is **tiered**: one question
 * picks the part of the catalog, a second picks the tool inside it.
 *
 * The first answer is read as a *distribution* rather than a pick. Taking only
 * the argmax would make one debatable judgement fatal — the catalog files
 * `mosaic` under "Remote Sensing - Enhancement & Contrast", which no amount of
 * reasoning about "combine overlapping aerial tiles" will suggest — so the top
 * few categories are carried forward together and the second question chooses
 * across all of them at once. That costs nothing extra: it is still two round
 * trips, ~400ms in total.
 *
 * Nothing here replaces the keyword filter. The caller merges the two, so a
 * literal-word search keeps working exactly as before and the ranked semantic
 * hits sit in front of it. Selection can only add candidates the filter missed.
 *
 * Everything is pure except {@link selectCatalogTools}, the only function that
 * touches the network, so the tiering rules can be tested without an API key.
