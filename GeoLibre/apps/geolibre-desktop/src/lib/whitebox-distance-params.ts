// Ground-unit entry for the Processing toolbox's distance parameters.

// A vector layer on the map is always handed to a tool as GeoJSON, which RFC
// 7946 fixes to WGS84 — so a tool's spacing/search-radius/tolerance value is
// measured in *degrees*, not metres, and there is no CRS left on the layer to
// say so (GeoLibre#1540). These helpers recognize which numeric parameters are
// ground distances and convert a value typed in metres (or km/ft/mi) into the
// degrees the tool will actually use.
//
// The conversion is deliberately approximate: a degree in WGS84 is not a fixed
// ground distance, and a Euclidean distance in degree-space is direction
// dependent. The dialog says so next to the field, and reprojecting to a
// projected CRS remains the exact answer.
