/**
 * De-duplication for Add Vector Layer's remote downloads.
 *
 * A multi-layer container (a KMZ of KML folders, a GeoPackage of tables, a DXF)
 * becomes one store layer per source layer, but every one of them keeps the
 * *container's* URL. Restoring such a project replays each layer independently,
 * and auto-refresh ticks them independently too, so a six-layer KMZ issued six
 * concurrent downloads of the same archive on every project open and on every
 * refresh interval (opengeos/GeoLibre discussion #1757). On a slow origin that
 * is enough to blow the fetch budget and fail layers that would have loaded had
 * they asked once.
 *
 * `dedupeVectorUrlFetch` collapses those into a single in-flight request per
 * URL. Two properties matter:
 *
 * - **In-flight only.** The entry is dropped as soon as the download settles, so
 *   this is a request collapser and never a cache: a later auto-refresh always
 *   re-downloads and genuinely refreshes the layer. Sibling layers of one
 *   container share a download only because they ask within the same window.
 * - **One identity.** Every caller gets the *same* `File` object, not a copy.
 *   maplibre-gl-vector keys its per-source caches (the unzipped KML it
 *   registers with DuckDB, a GeoPackage's bytes) on the source object, so
 *   handing all six layers one identical `File` collapses the unzip and the
 *   DuckDB registration too: a 91 MB KML is registered once instead of six
 *   times. Returning a `Blob` would not: the control wraps a plain `Blob` in a
 *   fresh `File` per call, and the caches would miss again.
 */

/**
 * In-flight downloads keyed by URL. Entries live only until they settle.
 *
 * The value is a wrapper rather than the bare promise so the download's own
 * `finally` can identify (and clear) exactly its own entry while still running
 * *inside* the promise. A `.finally()` chained onto the outside would resolve a
 * tick after awaiting callers, leaving a settled entry briefly visible and
 * letting an immediate retry share an already-finished download.
