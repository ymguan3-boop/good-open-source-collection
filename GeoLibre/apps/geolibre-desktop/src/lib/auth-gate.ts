 * Clerk and Auth0 are configured independently and only one is ever loaded, so
 * a deployment that names both needs a rule. It is the same rule the individual
 * settings already follow (see deployment-env.ts): the deployment env is the
 * more specific statement, so a provider named there wins over one baked into
 * the build. Naming both at the same level keeps Clerk, which shipped first —
 * an image built with a Clerk key must not switch providers on its own. The
 * Docker entrypoint refuses to boot when both are passed at runtime, so that
 * tie only arises from build-time environment variables.
 *
 * @param webApp - Whether this is the hosted web build. Must be derived from
 *   the build target alone: a runtime signal the visitor controls (`?embed=1`)
 *   would let anyone switch a configured gate off.
 * @param deploymentEnv - Runtime env; defaults to the value on `window`.
 * @param buildEnv - Build-time env; defaults to the allowlisted build env.
 * @returns The provider and its settings, or undefined when no gate is configured.
