/**
 * Searching the Whitebox toolbox by meaning rather than by substring.
 *
 * The toolbox's filter box is a substring match, so it answers only when the
 * user already knows the word the catalog uses. Type "remove sinks so water
 * drains off the edge" and it finds nothing at all, because no tool is named
 * "sinks" — the tool is `fill_depressions`. Measured over 20 requests phrased
 * in plain words, the tiered Jev lookup in {@link ./assistant/catalog-select}
 * put the right tool first 19 times where the substring filter found nothing.
 *
 * That lookup is the assistant's, but nothing about it is assistant-shaped:
 * {@link selectCatalogTools} takes a query, a catalog and an endpoint. This
 * module is the toolbox's side of it — when to spend a round trip, and what to
 * send — so the dialog never touches the assistant's plumbing directly.
 *
 * Three rules shape it, all from the same worry: the filter box is instant and
 * the lookup is not, so the lookup must never make the box feel slower or make
 * the list move under someone already reading it.
 *
 * 1. **It is invisible when unavailable.** With no System One endpoint
 *    configured — the default — {@link whiteboxSemanticSearchEndpoint} returns
 *    null, nothing runs, and the dialog renders exactly as it did before.
 * 2. **It runs rarely.** Never per keystroke: the caller debounces, and
 *    {@link shouldSearchWhiteboxByMeaning} then insists the query is either a
 *    phrase (a description, which is the case substrings cannot answer) or a
 *    single word the catalog barely matches. A one-word search that already
 *    returns a full list is answered by the substring filter, which now ranks
 *    the tool of that name first anyway.
 * 3. **It adds, never reorders.** The caller renders the ranked hits as their
 *    own group above the substring list rather than merging into it, so the
 *    list someone is reading keeps its order.
