/**
 * Built-in object-detection models for the Object Detection dialog (issue #902).
 *
 * These are stock COCO YOLO models exported to ONNX, hosted on jsDelivr (which
 * serves with permissive CORS, so the browser/webview can fetch them directly)
 * and pinned to immutable commit SHAs so the file can never change under us.
 * They let a user run detection without supplying their own `.onnx`.
 *
 * Source repos (MIT-licensed browser demos); the YOLOv5/v8 weights themselves
 * are AGPL-3.0 from Ultralytics. We link and download at runtime rather than
 * bundle them. Because they are COCO/ground-level models they detect everyday
 * objects well but perform poorly on top-down aerial imagery, where a
 * user-supplied overhead-trained model is the better choice.
 *
 * Provenance/trust note: these URLs point at a third-party individual's public
 * repos, not an official Ultralytics/ONNX-zoo source. The immutable commit-SHA
 * pin is the main mitigation (jsDelivr serves that exact byte content); the
 * remaining risk is availability if the account/repo is ever deleted. Follow-up:
 * mirror these files into a GeoLibre-controlled repo so the built-in option does
 * not depend on an external account.
