/**
 * Client for **OGC API - Features** services (the successor to WFS).
 *
 * A service is a tree of JSON documents rooted at a landing page: `/collections`
 * lists the feature collections, and `/collections/{id}/items` returns GeoJSON.
 * Unlike WFS there is no capabilities document and no output-format negotiation
 * to guess at — GeoJSON is the mandated encoding — but responses are **paged**:
 * a server answers with at most its own page size and advertises a `next` link,
 * so a naive single request commonly yields only the first 10 features.
 *
 * This module owns the three things the Add Data source needs:
 *
 * - {@link parseOgcFeaturesUrl}, which accepts whatever URL the user has in
 *   hand (landing page, `/collections`, a collection, or a full `/items` URL,
 *   which is what a service's HTML browser puts in the address bar) and splits
 *   it into a base URL plus collection id.
 * - {@link fetchOgcFeatureCollections}, the collection picker's list.
 * - {@link fetchOgcFeatureItems}, which follows `next` links until the
 *   requested feature count is reached and reports whether more remain.

 * sorts the pair, so a crossing box silently returns the *complement* of what
 * the user is looking at. Widening only narrows less; it is a superset of the
 * view under either reading, and the latitudes still do their share of the
 * filtering.
 *
 * Latitudes are clamped rather than wrapped — a camera tilted toward the pole
 * reports beyond ±90°, and the box there really is the pole.
