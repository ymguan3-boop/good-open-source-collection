# Privacy policy — Open data in GeoLibre

Last updated: August 18, 2026

Open data in GeoLibre does not independently collect, retain, or sell personal
information, page contents, or usage analytics. It does forward the complete
dataset, service, and style URLs that the user explicitly selects,
as described below.

The extension uses Chrome's `activeTab` permission to inspect the current page
only after the user clicks the extension's toolbar icon. In that moment it reads
the page's links and structured metadata, and reads back the addresses of the
requests the page has already made, from the Resource Timing record each
document keeps of its own loading, to identify geospatial services used by
interactive maps. It does not inspect response bodies, and it does not observe
the network or run in the background at any other time. Nothing is stored: the
list exists only while the popup is open and is discarded when it closes.

When the user chooses **Open in GeoLibre**, the complete selected HTTP(S)
dataset and style URLs are placed in the query string of a new
`https://web.geolibre.app/` tab. These URLs are forwarded verbatim and may
contain signed query parameters, access tokens, user identifiers, or other
personal data. Do not select a URL containing information you do not want to
send to GeoLibre.

The navigation request exposes its URL and the user's IP address to GeoLibre's
web-hosting infrastructure, where standard service logs may retain them. The
navigation may also appear in browser history. See the current
[GeoLibre privacy policy](https://geolibre.app/privacy/) for the service's data
practices. The extension itself never persists a URL.

The extension does not fetch or upload the datasets. GeoLibre requests them
directly from their original servers, subject to those servers' privacy
policies and CORS configuration. Cookies and other browser-session credentials
from the source page are not forwarded, although credentials embedded directly
in a selected URL are part of the URL and are forwarded.

The extension uses no remote code, advertising, analytics, tracking pixels,
cookies, accounts, or extension storage of any kind. It holds no host
permissions and no permission to observe browsing.
